It is essential for children\\nto gain narrative knowledge so as to discuss and organize their lives into meaningful episodes. To\\nbe understood by naive conversational partners, however, it is suggested that children\\u2019s stories need\\nto be structured chronologically, include causal links to the goals and motivations of characters, and\\nprovide suf\\ufb01cient background information ( Peterson, 1994 ). This story construction knowledge is usu-\\nally assumed to develop through parent\\u2013child routines. One routine is shared book reading.\\nInterestingly, correlational studies suggest that early narrative skills are related to children\\u2019s later\\nliteracy development, with moderate to strong relations existing between the production of \\ufb01ctional\\nnarratives and concurrent, as well as future, reading comprehension ( Grif\\ufb01n, Hemphill, Camp, & Wolf,\\n2004; O\\u2019Neill, Pearce, & Pick, 2004; Snow, Porche, Tabors, & Harris, 2007 ). However, although correla-\\ntional research has found links between story construction skills and literacy, there is a lack of con-\\ncrete evidence supporting a causal relationship between shared book reading and storytelling skills.\\nIn the current study, we examined whether shared book reading was causally linked to \\ufb01ctional nar-\\nrative construction abilities.\\nNarrative construction skills undergo extensive development between 2 and 5 years of age, begin-\\nning with toddlers uttering single-phrase two-word utterances and ending with complex multiepisod-\\nic stories. At 5 years of age, typically developing children from middle-income homes are able to\\nproduce narratives that are chronologically structured and sequential, although these stories often\\nend abruptly without proper conclusions ( Peterson & McCabe, 1983 ). In addition, 5-year-olds are able\\nto include some words, such as andand then, that connect sentences together cohesively (Peterson &\\nMcCabe, 1991) and are able to include enough details about characters to allow a naive listener to\\nunderstand who are the protagonists and what are some of their thoughts and motivations ( Stein &\\nGlenn, 1979 ).\\nNarrative skills do not develop at the same rate in all children; children from low-income house-\\nholds, for example, have been found to have de\\ufb01cits in storytelling skills when compared with their\\npeers from middle-income households ( Peterson, 1994 ). Given the discrepancy in narrative skills\\nacross economic populations, the development of narrative skills cannot be governed entirely by mat-\\nuration. Instead, it is theorized that children acquire storytelling skills through social interaction.\\nVygotskian theory suggests that parents \\u2018\\u2018scaffold\\u201d their children into developing better narrative\\nskills ( Vygotsky, 1978 ). More simply, during dialogues with learned others, children encounter narra-\\ntives that are more sophisticated than their own and internalize the skills that allow them to improve\\ntheir own constructions.\\nSupport for this notion is found in intervention studies that focused on the development of auto-\\nbiographical stories. These intervention studies showed that training mothers to ask more elaborative,\\nopen-ended \\u2018\\u2018wh-\\u201d questions while engaging in autobiographical narrative dialogues with children\\nimproved the quality of narratives produced by 3- to 5-year-olds ( Peterson, Jesso, & McCabe, 1999 ).\\nIn addition, parents can tailor questions asked to improve speci\\ufb01c aspects of narrative skills ( Peterson\\n& McCabe, 2004 ). For example, parents can scaffold children to better contextualize their narratives by\\nasking for more context detail in their questioning (e.g., who, what, when, where). Thus, through feed-\\nback from their conversation partners, children encode the relevant information on autobiographical\\nstorytelling that is emphasized in joint discussion ( Nelson, 2007 ).\\nIn addition to the study of autobiographical narrative knowledge as described above, researchers\\nhave investigated children\\u2019s acquisition of \\ufb01ctional narrative knowledge (e.g., Mandler, 1984; Stein\\n& Glenn, 1979 ). Telling \\ufb01ctional stories seems to be an important skill linked to later literacy develop-\\nment given that 12 of the 15 investigations on the relation between narratives and literacy that were\\nfound required children to tell \\ufb01ctional stories unassisted by a conversational partner (for critical anal-\\nyses of six of these articles, see O\\u2019Neill et al., 2004 ; Roth, Speece, Cooper, & De la Paz, 1996). Moreover,\\n\\ufb01ctional storytelling, prompted by wordless picture books or other stimuli, is often used by speech\\nlanguage pathologists to assess oral language delays ( Melzi & Caspe, 2008 ). Given the relationship be-\\ntween \\ufb01ctional narratives and later literacy, it is important to understand how and in what contexts\\nchildren might acquire information on \\ufb01ctional narrative construction.\\nOne context that might promote \\ufb01ctional narrative knowledge is book reading. The illustrations\\nthemselves in picture books may help to foster the acquisition of \\ufb01ctional narrative knowledge. Paris2 R. Lever, M. S\\u00e9n\\u00e9chal / Journal of Experimental Child Psychology 108 (2011) 1\\u201324\\nand Paris (2003) suggested that young children learn to \\u2018\\u2018read\\u201d the pictures in a picture book to ascer-\\ntain the meanings of narrative components and add these understandings to their narrative schemas.\\nHowever, young children\\u2019s main exposure to books typically occurs during adult\\u2013child shared book\\nreading. In these activities, adults may give information about the plot, supporting the narrative ele-\\nments found in the illustrations and, thus, emphasizing narrative knowledge ( Graham, 1990 ). For\\nexample, a picture of a boy crying may help children to understand the character\\u2019s emotional response\\nto an event, and a parent may explain the picture to the child in terms of the events causing the child\\u2019s\\ntears, thereby highlighting elements of narrative plot.\\nHowever, during shared book reading, parents may be supplying narrative knowledge in other\\nways than simply reading the text and explaining pictures. Shared reading provides a context where\\ndialogues about the \\ufb01ctional stories in storybooks can be created, and these dialogues could empha-\\nsize narrative elements that are present both in pictures and in the text. Parents may ask and answer\\nquestions during shared reading, thereby creating a dialogic environment that contains many oppor-\\ntunities for adults to scaffold narrative elements in a manner similar to adult\\u2013child dialogues about\\npast events. In the current study, the focus was on the possibility of children learning \\ufb01ctional narra-tive skills from shared adult\\u2013child reading.\\nPast research has not found a de\\ufb01nitive answer as to whether or not shared reading in\\ufb02uences chil-\\ndren\\u2019s narrative knowledge. S\\u00e9n\\u00e9chal, Pagan, Lever, and Ouellette (2008) did not \\ufb01nd an association\\nbetween the frequency of shared reading at home and children\\u2019s ability to produce narratives, either\\n\\ufb01ctional or autobiographical. That study, however, did not assess the quality of the parent\\u2013child inter-\\nactions during shared reading. Investigation of the natural reading behaviors of parents with their pre-\\nschoolers found that parents do not typically engage in interactive reading with their children\\n(Whitehurst et al., 1988 ). In fact, parents\\u2019 reading styles typically include few dialogues, and these dia-\\nlogues involve mainly yes/no questions or directives. Most often, parents read the text directly with-\\nout engaging their children in the story or the discourse ( Huebner & Meltzoff, 2005 ). Is it the case that\\nshared reading enhances children\\u2019s narrative skills only when adults adopt a dialogic interaction style\\nduring shared reading?\\nRecognizing that a more active role in storybook reading may be bene\\ufb01cial to children\\u2019s literacy\\ndevelopment, Whitehurst et al. (1988) designed an intervention called dialogic reading that is meant\\nto encourage adults to create dialogues during story time (see Mol, Bus, de Jong, & Smeets, 2008 ,\\nfor an up-to-date meta-analysis of the dialogic reading literature). During reading sessions, the adult\\nreader is required to encourage children\\u2019s oral contributions using elaborative \\u2018\\u2018wh-\\u201d and open-ended\\nquestions, repetition of good responses, and expansion of incomplete responses to illustrate the differ-\\nence between what was said and what could have been said. This reading technique has been found to\\npositively impact literacy skills in young children; in particular, most of the research conducted on this\\ntype of intervention has focused on the impact of dialogic reading on expressive vocabulary. In fact,\\npositive gains in expressive vocabulary were found in children between 3 and 5 years of age ( Crain-\\nThoreson & Dale, 1999; Lonigan & Whitehurst, 1998; Wasik & Bond, 2001; Whitehurst, Arnold,\\net al., 1994; Whitehurst, Epstein, et al., 1994 ) when conducted in groups of up to eight children ( Har-\\ngrave & S\\u00e9n\\u00e9chal, 2000; Lonigan & Whitehurst, 1998; Whitehurst, Arnold, et al., 1994 ) and when com-\\npared with an alternative treatment comparison group ( Arnold, Lonigan, Whitehurst, & Epstein, 1994;\\nLonigan & Whitehurst, 1998; Valdez-Menchaca & Whitehurst, 1992; Whitehurst, Arnold, et al., 1994 ).\\nYoung children are clearly internalizing language knowledge highlighted by interactive shared\\nreading.\\nAlthough the dialogic reading literature focuses on improving vocabulary skills, the types of \\u2018\\u2018wh-\\u201d\\nquestions used to create dialogues about storybooks are not unlike the elaborative questions that have\\nbeen found to improve children\\u2019s narrative skills. Therefore, it is hypothesized that using this dialogic\\nreading procedure, in the context of books that highlight story elements, would impact narrative skills.A search of the published literature yielded a single study testing the impact of dialogic reading on\\nnarrative knowledge. Zevenbergen, Whitehurst, and Zevenebergen (2003) determined that using a\\ndialogic reading intervention could enhance children\\u2019s inclusion of some important aspects of narra-\\ntives within their retellings of heard stories such as children\\u2019s inclusion of more details about the char-\\nacters\\u2019 mental states, motivation, and dialogues. However, that study was limited to investigating only\\na few aspects of narrative knowledge in a retelling paradigm. The current study was conducted toR. Lever, M. S\\u00e9n\\u00e9chal / Journal of Experimental Child Psychology 108 (2011) 1\\u201324 3\\ndetermine whether a dialogic reading intervention could enhance a wider range of narrative compo-\\nnents in both a retelling and production paradigm. These components are meant to represent the dif-\\nferent areas of narrative knowledge that children would need to grasp so as to create chronological,\\ncomplex, cohesive, and contextual narratives.\\nComponents of narrative skillsKnowledge about narrative structure\\nTo measure a child\\u2019s structural knowledge, the narratives are analyzed for the story elements that\\nmake up a story grammar. A story grammar is a sequence of elements that are essential to a structured\\nstory plot, and as such they include introductions, setting details, character descriptions and emo-\\ntional/cognitive responses of the characters, initiating events, plans to solve con\\ufb02icts, attempts to\\nsolve con\\ufb02icts, reactions to events, and conclusions ( Stein & Glenn, 1979 ). Story grammar units are\\nthe basic elements of a story that organize story events in a sequential and meaningful way. In fact,\\nthe structure of a narrative is considered to be equivalent to the gist or central meaning of a story\\n(Mandler, 1984 ). Internal responses and internal plan story grammar units were assessed separately\\nas a subset of narrative structure called mental state references. This was done to con\\ufb01rm \\ufb01ndings\\nbyZevenbergen et al. (2003) .\\nLinguistic knowledge\\nMeasures of language complexity that demonstrate a child\\u2019s ability to produce linguistic compo-\\nnents within the narratives were used. These measures include the total number of words, the ratio\\nof number of different words spoken over total number of words, and the mean length of utterances.\\nThe ratio of different words to total words re\\ufb02ects the amount of varied language used and expresses\\nthe complexity of the child\\u2019s narrative language. Furthermore, the mean length of utterances was cal-\\nculated to determine whether the child was more likely to have longer and more complex syntax. This\\nmeasure was \\ufb01rst described as a measure of language complexity by Brown (1973) and subsequently\\nwas used as a measure of syntactic knowledge for children up to 5 years of age ( Bishop & Adams, 1990;\\nMiller & Chapman, 1981 ).\\nContextual knowledge\\nA child\\u2019s use of decontextualized language such as anaphora can serve as an index of contextual\\nknowledge. Anaphora is a linguistic term for an expression referring to a previously mentioned idea.\\nWhen a character is introduced, it is appropriate to \\ufb01rst mention this character by his or her name or\\nthe title of the being preceded by an inde\\ufb01nite article. For example, the proper way to introduce a rab-\\nbit character is to call him or her a rabbit orSam. Once a character has been introduced within the fo-\\ncus of the discourse, it is acceptable to refer the character by a pronoun or another appropriate label\\nsuch as heorthe rabbit in the case of the bunny character. Young children, however, have dif\\ufb01culty\\nwith this grammar rule and often assume shared knowledge with a naive listener and introduce char-\\nacters in their narratives as heorshe(Hickmann & Hendriks, 1999 ).\\nCohesion knowledge\\nThe integration of structure, content knowledge, and linguistic knowledge can be assessed by\\ncounting the number and variety of connectives produced (Peterson & McCabe, 1991). Connectives\\nare said to tie the story together by semantically relating clauses together. It may be the story gram-\\nmar units that structure the overall narrative, but the connectives act to link the story together at the\\nlocal clausal level ( Cain, 2003 ). Higher quality narratives might differ not only in the number of con-\\nnectives but also in the variety of connectives used. Therefore, the appropriate use of cohesive ties was\\nmeasured in the current study.\\nRetelling and production paradigms\\nWithin the \\ufb01eld of \\ufb01ctional narrative research, no consensus has been determined on the narrative\\nparadigm that best assesses a child\\u2019s narrative construction ability. Two main types of tasks dominate4 R. Lever, M. S\\u00e9n\\u00e9chal / Journal of Experimental Child Psychology 108 (2011) 1\\u201324\\nthe \\ufb01eld: narrative retelling tasks and narrative production tasks. Narrative retelling tasks are so\\nnamed because participants are \\ufb01rst told an oral story and then asked to retell this story at some point\\nthereafter; however, the prompt, procedure, listener, time period, and medium vary across the liter-\\nature. In any given retelling task, a participant may be asked to retell a story in the presence of a famil-\\niar listener ( Merritt & Liles, 1989 ) or a naive listener ( Botting, 2002 ) and based on a series of pictures\\nor a picture book ( Hesketh, 2004 ), a video ( Merritt & Liles, 1989 ), a \\ufb01lm strip ( Coelho, 2002 ), a purely\\noral narrative with no props ( Ukrainetz et al., 2005 ), and so on.\\nNarrative production tasks, alternatively, are tasks in which participants are asked to produce a no-\\nvel \\ufb01ctional narrative based on an initial prompt. Similar to retelling tasks, production tasks have a\\nvariety of contexts and methods that are not standardized. For example, participants may be asked\\nto produce a \\ufb01ctional story based on story stems (the \\ufb01rst sentence of a story [ Merritt & Liles,\\n1989 ]), one picture ( Coelho, 2002 ), several pictures ( Hickmann & Hendriks, 1999 ), a wordless story-\\nbook ( Botting, 2002 ), a video ( Eaton, Collis, & Lewis, 1999 ), and so on.\\nBecause no consensus on the type of task, even within the retelling or production genres, can be\\nachieved, it seems ill advised to treat retelling and production tasks as tasks that elicit equivalentnarrative skills. In fact, comparison studies have suggested that the retelling task may be easier for\\nchildren, resulting in children demonstrating a more logically structured, linguistically complex, con-\\nnected and contextualized story than when they are asked to produce a novel story ( Merritt & Liles,\\n1989 ). Furthermore, it is possible that the retelling task is more a measure of children\\u2019s comprehension\\nof story elements than a measure of their ability to construct a narrative ( Nelson, 2007 ). In the current\\nstudy, both narrative production and retelling tasks were assessed to distinguish any differing effects of\\nshared book reading on these two paradigms.\\nThe current study\\nThis study tested whether a shared reading intervention would improve kindergartners\\u2019 narrative\\nability as compared with children receiving an alternative treatment. The intervention was adminis-\\ntered in small groups twice a week for 8 weeks. It was hypothesized that dialogic reading should en-\\nhance the four key aspects of narrative ability\\u2014story structure, language complexity, cohesion, and\\ndecontextualized language\\u2014through the appropriate use of anaphora. Furthermore, the retelling task\\nshould be easier for children to complete; therefore, the effects of the intervention should be more dis-\\ncernible in the children\\u2019s retelling stories.\\nMethods\\nParticipants\\nParticipants were 40 English-speaking 5-year-olds who were recruited from kindergarten pro-\\ngrams in a large city in central Canada. The kindergarten classrooms were in schools identi\\ufb01ed by their\\nschool board as located in neighborhoods that have high concentrations of low-income households\\nand greater mobility of residents than neighborhoods for other schools in the school board district.\\nHowever, a letter sent home through teachers to parents asking for consent for their children\\u2019s\\ninvolvement in the study also asked for information on socioeconomic status (SES), and it appears that\\nparents who gave permission for their children to participate in this study re\\ufb02ected a more varied in-\\ncome level. Of the entire sample, 73% of parents provided information about their highest level of edu-\\ncation achieved and 85% of parents provided annual income information. Of the parents who indicated\\ntheir highest level of education, 6% had not completed high school, 29% were high school educated,\\n24% were college educated, 21% had university degrees, and 21% were completing or had completed\\npostgraduate studies. Furthermore, in terms of parents\\u2019 income, 31% reported an annual income of less\\nthan $20,000,\\n114% reported an annual income between $20,000 and $39,999, 10.3% reported an annual\\nincome between $40,000 and $59,999, 24% reported an annual income between $60,000 and $79,999,\\nand 21% reported an annual income of $80,000 or more.\\n1All incomes reported are in Canadian dollars.R. Lever, M. S\\u00e9n\\u00e9chal / Journal of Experimental Child Psychology 108 (2011) 1\\u201324 5\\nNone of the participating children had hearing dif\\ufb01culties or were receiving speech therapy. In\\naddition, their pretest scores did not reveal dif\\ufb01culty in understanding instructions due to English\\nas a second language, and their receptive vocabulary scores were within 2.5 standard deviations of\\nthe sample mean.\\nSelected children were randomly assigned on the school level to either the dialogic reading group\\nor the alternative treatment group regardless of classroom. Due to group assignment error, uneven\\ngroups were created, with 21 children (9 boys and 12 girls) being assigned to the dialogic reading\\nintervention condition and 19 children (9 boys and 10 girls) being assigned to the alternative treat-\\nment group. The dialogic reading children had a mean age of 5 years 4 months ( SD= 3.6 months) at\\nthe date of pretest, and the alternative treatment children had a mean age of 5 years 3 months\\n(SD= 4.9 months). Finally, 75% of the participants came from homes where English was the language\\nspoken most often. Of the remaining 25%, four children in the dialogic reading group and six children\\nin the alternative treatment group spoke another language most often at home. Other languages spo-\\nken most often in the homes of children in the sample were Chinese, Somali, Urdu, Turkish, Amharic,\\nArabic, Persian, and Bengali.\\nMeasuresNarrative measures\\nFictional narrative ability was measured using the Edmonton Narrative Norms Instrument (ENNI)\\n(Schneider, Dub\\u00e9, & Hayward, 2002 ). The ENNI is a storytelling assessment tool for 4- to 9-year-olds\\nand normalized on a sample of 377 children in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. The tool includes four word-\\nless black and white picture books that portray a series of stories. The books are divided into two sets of\\npicture books depicting illustrated animal characters in obvious con\\ufb02ict-based plots. One set is illus-\\ntrated to depict stories about a giraffe and an elephant at a pool (pool series), and the other set is illus-\\ntrated to depict stories about a mouse and a dog at a park (park series). Each set contains a short picture\\nbook and a long picture book. The short picture books are \\ufb01ve pages long and depict one complete story\\ngrammar episode. The short picture books were used for the pretest portion of the current study. The\\nlong picture books are 14 pages long and contain three complete story grammar episodes about the same\\ntwo main characters, with an additional two characters being added in the second and third episodes,\\nrespectively. These long picture books were used for the posttest version of the study.\\nAlthough the ENNI is a production narrative task only, for the purpose of the study, a retelling task\\nwas designed with novel narratives based on the same wordless picture books that were used for pro-\\nducing narratives; that is, texts (presented in Appendix A) that correspond to the pictures for the pool\\nbooks (short and long) and the park books (short and long) were created. The texts describe the plots\\nof the books and include the appropriate number of story grammar units that are meant to be depicted\\nin each story. In addition, they were designed to be comparable in length, description, dialogue, and\\nemotive language to the other short or long story. As such, the short pool story was 177 words long\\nand the short park story was 172 words long. Similarly, the long pool story was 410 words long\\nand the long park story was 416 words long.\\nIn the narrative retelling task, the participants were expected to listen carefully to the examiner-\\ncreated story that was read aloud to them (see Appendix A). Immediately afterward, the participants\\nwere asked to retell the same story back to the experimenter and were told that their version of the\\nstory would be audiotaped. For each participant, the experimenter held the book facing the child and\\ntold the child that he or she could not see the pictures, nor could the people who would listen to the\\ntapes, so the child needed to tell the story really well to be understood. If the child had trouble in\\nbeginning the narrative or stopped halfway through it, the experimenter was allowed to prompt\\nthe child to continue according to a list of prompts included in the ENNI ( Schneider et al., 2002 ). Per-\\nmissible prompts included questions such as \\u2018\\u2018How would you start your story?\\u201d and \\u2018\\u2018Look at the pic-\\ntures\\u2014what do you think is happening in the story?\\u201d The examiner was allowed to ask six prompts\\nbefore turning the page if the child still did not respond. If the child could not get started after two\\npages, testing was terminated.\\nIn the production task, the procedure followed closely the original task design of the ENNI. The chil-\\ndren were shown pictures in the second wordless picture book that had not been used previously and6 R. Lever, M. S\\u00e9n\\u00e9chal / Journal of Experimental Child Psychology 108 (2011) 1\\u201324\\nwere told that they were required to create their own story based on the pictures. For each participant,\\nafter the child was shown all of the pictures, the examiner held the book facing the child and asked the\\nchild to begin telling the story. Again, the experimenter told the child that he or she could not see the\\npictures, nor could the people who would listen to the tapes, and that he or she would not properly\\nunderstand the story if it was not told well.\\nAll narrative tasks were recorded onto audio disks that were later transcribed according to the Con-\\nventions for the Human Analysis of Transcripts (CHAT) ( MacWhinney, 2000 ). The Child Language\\nAnalysis (CLAN) program, available from the Child Language Data Exchange System (CHILDES) ( Mac-\\nWhinney, 2000 ), is an analysis program that is popularly used within the language development re-\\nsearch \\ufb01eld to obtain measures of language complexity and story cohesion ( MacWhinney & Snow,\\n1985 ). Children\\u2019s resulting narratives were scored on four dimensions: story grammar units, language\\ncomplexity, cohesion, and anaphora. Coders were naive to group assignment. Each dimension is de-\\nscribed in turn.\\nNarrative structure\\nNarratives were coded for story grammar units using the ENNI instructions ( Schneider et al., 2002 )\\nbut including two adaptations. First, a story grammar scoring scheme was created for the park stories\\nbased on the ENNI scheme for the pool series. Second, beginning and closing statements were scored\\nbecause these are traditionally included in story grammar analysis ( Stein & Glenn, 1979 ), although\\nthey are not included in the ENNI scoring scheme. Within this analysis, a formal beginning statement\\nrefers to the use of a clich\\u00e9 story opening such as \\u2018\\u2018Once upon a time\\u201d or \\u2018\\u2018One day.\\u201d An informal begin-\\nning statement refers to the use of an opening phrase that is not clich\\u00e9d but rather is set outside of the\\ntimeline of the current story such as \\u2018\\u2018Jack the bunny and Devin the dog had always been really good\\nfriends.\\u201d Similarly, a formal closing statement refers to a clich\\u00e9d ending such as \\u2018\\u2018The end\\u201d or \\u2018\\u2018And they\\nlived happily ever after,\\u201d whereas an informal closing statement refers to a phrase that is not clich\\u00e9d but\\nstill summarizes the story such as \\u2018\\u2018And they played together for the rest of the day.\\u201d Each formal\\nbeginning/closing statement was awarded 2 points, whereas each informal beginning/closing state-\\nment was awarded 1 point.\\nThe 12 story grammar units coded were formal beginning statement, informal beginning statement,\\ncharacter, setting, initiating event, internal response, internal plan, attempt, outcome, reaction of the char-\\nacter, formal closing statement, and informal closing statement . The units initiating event ,attempt , and\\noutcome were considered to be essential to the creation of a good story that is meant to convey a plot\\nand, thus, were given a score of 2, whereas the remaining units were given a score of 1. Total scores\\nfor the story grammar units per narrative were calculated, with the short single-episode storybooks\\nyielding a maximum score of 20 and the longer three-episode stories yielding a maximum score of 46.\\nA second subset score was computed for mental state references that included scores for internal re-\\nsponse and internal plan . Internal response story grammar units refer to an emotional or cognitive\\nreaction of a character to an event, whereas internal plan story grammar units refer to an explicit cog-\\nnition of a plan of action to deal with an initiating event such as \\u2018\\u2018He thought that he should jump in\\nthe pool to get the plane.\\u201d Children were awarded 1 point for each mention of a mental state\\nreference.\\nIntercoder reliability was assessed on 15% of narratives. Percentage agreement calculations were\\ndone such that the total number of times two researchers agreed on story grammar scores for one\\nstory was divided by the total possible story grammars per story. Of the 15% of narratives assessed,agreement rates between two independent researchers were 100% for the story grammar units setting ,\\ncharacters ,initiating event ,outcomes ,formal closing statement , and informal closing statement and were\\nbetween 80% and 99% for formal beginning statement ,informal beginning statement ,internal responses ,\\ninternal plans ,attempts , and reactions .\\nLanguage complexity\\nThe CLAN software was used to calculate the total number of words, total number of different\\nwords, number of utterances, mean length of utterances, and type token ratios (i.e., number of differ-\\nent words/total number of words). The ratio of different words to total words re\\ufb02ects the amount of\\nvaried language used and expresses the complexity of the children\\u2019s narrative language.R. Lever, M. S\\u00e9n\\u00e9chal / Journal of Experimental Child Psychology 108 (2011) 1\\u201324 7\\nContext\\nTo assess a child\\u2019s ability to appropriately contextualize a narrative, a measure of anaphora or\\ndecontextualized language referred to as \\u2018\\u2018\\ufb01rst mentions\\u201d was scored according to the instructions\\nof the ENNI ( Schneider et al., 2002 ). This analysis evaluates the appropriateness of referent expres-\\nsions that a child uses to introduce characters and objects when telling a story. Referring expressions\\nare linguistic forms used to refer to animate beings (e.g., the elephant ,Ella,she), objects (e.g., the train ,\\nit), places (e.g., the park ,there ), and concepts (e.g., an idea ). These expressions are considered to be ade-\\nquate if they are appropriate for the listener\\u2019s knowledge of the characters or objects. For example, a\\nspeci\\ufb01c inde\\ufb01nite noun phrase such as an elephant or a proper name is appropriate for the introduc-\\ntion of a character in a story, whereas the de\\ufb01nite article thepreceding elephant or the pronoun she\\nwould be appropriate only for a second or third mention of the character later in the story. Each men-\\ntion of the characters was scored with a 1, 2, or 3 according to how appropriate the phrase used was\\nfor its position in the narrative. For instance, if a character was introduced with the label he, the child\\nwas given 1 point; if a character was introduced with a de\\ufb01nite article such as the bunny , the child was\\nawarded 2 points; if a character was introduced using the appropriate label a bunny orJack, the child\\nwas awarded 3 points.\\nConnectives\\nThe frequency and types of connectives used were calculated with the CLAN software. There were\\nthree types of connectives that were coded (Peterson & McCabe, 1991): (a) independent connectives,\\nthat is, connectives that join together two independent clauses (e.g., and,now); (b) temporal connec-\\ntives, that is, connectives that provide knowledge about the sequence or chronology of the clauses\\n(e.g., then,later ,\\ufb01rst,next,as soon as ,while ); and (c) dependent clauses, that is, connectives that join\\nsecondary clauses that are dependent on the \\ufb01rst clause, thereby contributing to a more complex sen-\\ntence structure (e.g., but,or,because ,if,so).\\nReceptive vocabulary\\nThe Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test III (PPVT-III) ( Dunn & Dunn, 1997 ) was used as a measure of\\nchildren\\u2019s receptive vocabulary. Children were asked to select which of four alternative pictures, dis-\\nplayed in a grid, best represents the word spoken by the experimenter. This measure was used as a\\ncontrol variable to ensure that the intervention and the alternative treatment group did not differ\\non this aspect of language. It was not administered at posttest given that researchers have repeatedly\\nfound that dialogic reading interventions have little to no impact on this standardized test of receptive\\nvocabulary. In a meta-analysis on the effects of dialogic reading, Mol et al. (2008) reviewed 12 studies\\nthat used the PPVT-III as a posttest measure, and according to the presented con\\ufb01dence intervals in\\ntheir article, 11 of these studies could not signi\\ufb01cantly demonstrate effects of the intervention on\\nreceptive vocabulary.\\nExpressive vocabulary\\nA measure of expressive vocabulary was created to assess vocabulary learning given the well-\\ndocumented evidence that dialogic reading can enhance expressive vocabulary (e.g., Hargrave &\\nS\\u00e9n\\u00e9chal, 2000; S\\u00e9n\\u00e9chal, 1997 ). A total of 16 target words introduced and illustrated in the sto-\\nrybooks used were selected because they were assumed to be unknown to 5-year-olds: grocer ,\\nfawn ,carton ,pelican ,beret ,partridge ,telescope ,easel ,satchel ,fedora ,boulder ,maestro ,spatula ,ser-\\npent,caboose , and hen.A si n S\\u00e9n\\u00e9chal (1997) , these target words were unfamiliar words that rep-\\nresented familiar concepts to the children. For example, words such as satchel for bag and fedora\\nfor hat were used.\\nThe target words were tested by asking children to label line drawings of each target word. If chil-\\ndren produced synonyms for target words, the synonyms were noted and the children were asked\\nwhether they knew other names for those concepts. The use of picture line drawings was essential\\nto determining whether vocabulary learned could be generalized to other contexts than the books\\nin which they were introduced.8 R. Lever, M. S\\u00e9n\\u00e9chal / Journal of Experimental Child Psychology 108 (2011) 1\\u201324\\nDialogic reading intervention\\nBooks\\nFrom the 20 books comprising the Read Together ,Talk Together kit (Pearson Learning Group, 2006 ),\\neight books were selected. Read Together ,Talk Together is a dialogic reading kit that was designed on\\nthe research conducted by Whitehurst and colleagues ( Whitehurst, Arnold, et al., 1994; Whitehurst,\\nEpstein, et al., 1994; Whitehurst et al., 1988 ). It includes colorfully illustrated children\\u2019s books appro-\\npriate for the age level of 4 or 5 years. Of the books included in the kit, eight were chosen based on the\\nfollowing criteria. First, they included colorful illustrations that depicted the story to prevent complete\\nreliance on the text. Second, storybooks had obvious narrative plots following the typical initiating\\nevent\\u2013attempt\\u2013outcome chronology ( Stein & Glenn, 1979 ). Third, they were not alphabet books or\\nnon\\ufb01ction books that do not contain plots. Fourth, they were not holiday speci\\ufb01c (e.g., based on Christ-\\nmas events). The titles of the chosen books are presented in Appendix B.\\nThe kits for the books included pamphlets that detailed lists of dialogic questions that could be\\nasked during the reading of the books. From the lists provided, elaborative questions were selectedwith reference to Peterson and McCabe (2004) as the questions best related to the learning of narra-\\ntive knowledge. That is, the questions referred to plot, setting, evaluation of characters, and so on.\\nThese questions were used in addition to the spontaneous repetition, expansion, and recasting of chil-\\ndren\\u2019s oral contributions and any means of encouraging dialogue that may arise spontaneously. The\\nquestions were pasted on the appropriate pages of the books to ensure standardization and compli-\\nance to the dialogic reading method across interveners. Each book introduced two target words to\\nbe tested with the expressive vocabulary measure.\\nDialogic reading training\\nThree researchers were trained to administer the dialogic reading intervention during a 1-h group\\nsession. These interveners were \\ufb01rst shown a 15-min video provided by the Read Together ,Talk To-\\ngether kit depicting real-life examples of teachers using the dialogic reading prompts effectively. Next,\\na standard list of prompts used in this type of intervention were reviewed, and interveners partici-\\npated in role-playing scenarios to familiarize themselves with the techniques. The techniques learned\\nincluded questioning and giving feedback such as (a) asking \\u2018\\u2018wh-\\u201d questions (i.e., what, where, when,\\nwhy, who, which, and how questions), (b) following correct answers with expansions, (c) repeating\\nwhat the child says, (d) helping the child as needed, (e) praising and encouraging more interaction,\\nand (f) shadowing the child\\u2019s interest. The techniques require the adult to ask open-ended questions\\nand expand on the child\\u2019s comments, to encourage the child to produce multiword expressions and\\nlearn story structure, and to overall ensure the enjoyment of the child during storybook reading\\n(Whitehurst, Arnold, et al., 1994 ).\\nIn addition to using the elaborative questions included in each storybook, interveners were taught\\nto expand on the children\\u2019s responses in speci\\ufb01c ways to emphasize all four levels of narrative knowl-\\nedge. To emphasize plot structure, interveners were taught to sometimes highlight the entire plot ofthe story when expanding on the children\\u2019s responses. For example, if an intervener asked the ques-\\ntion \\u2018\\u2018What does Walter do after his dad leaves the room?\\u201d and the child responded with \\u2018\\u2018He jumps on\\nthe bed,\\u201d the intervener was encouraged to rephrase the answer in a manner such as \\u2018\\u2018That\\u2019s right,\\neven though Walter\\u2019s dad told him not to jump on the bed, he decided to jump on the bed as soon\\nas his dad left the room.\\u201d Similarly, to emphasize the importance of language complexity and descrip-\\ntion, interveners were asked to include adjectives in some of their responses. For example, using the\\nsame question, an intervener might rephrase the child\\u2019s response with \\u2018\\u2018That\\u2019s right, he excitedly\\njumps on the bed.\\u201d The inclusion of the adjective excitedly emphasizes the need to include descriptions\\nwithin the narrative storytelling. Cohesion-based expansions were provided by the interveners by\\nadding connectives to the children\\u2019s responses. For example, the intervener might have expanded\\non this response with \\u2018\\u2018That\\u2019s right, after Walter\\u2019s dad told him not to jump on the bed, he started\\njumping on the bed as soon as his dad left the room\\u201d to emphasize the importance of connector inclu-\\nsion within a narrative. Finally, context concepts might be emphasized within response expansions\\nwhen the experimenter clari\\ufb01es ambiguous concepts within a response. For example, the intervenerR. Lever, M. S\\u00e9n\\u00e9chal / Journal of Experimental Child Psychology 108 (2011) 1\\u201324 9\\nmight reply by replacing the ambiguous hepronoun with the name of the character such that the re-\\nsponse would now look like \\u2018\\u2018That\\u2019s right, Walter jumps on the bed.\\u201d\\nInterveners were also trained to emphasize the 16 target vocabulary words in the books. Interven-\\ners emphasized these words by giving the de\\ufb01nitions of the words and asking the children to repeat\\nthe correct vocabulary terms ( S\\u00e9n\\u00e9chal, 1997 ).\\nDialogic reading\\nEach intervener read dialogically with the same children in groups of one to four for two 20-min\\nsessions per week for 8 weeks. During each reading session, a single book was read, and over the\\ncourse of the intervention, each book was read twice to allow familiarity with the stories. The param-\\neters of the dialogic reading intervention were chosen to coincide with a concurrent intervention pro-\\ngram that was being administered; however, Hargrave and S\\u00e9n\\u00e9chal (2000) demonstrated that a\\ndialogic reading intervention could effectively improve children\\u2019s oral language skills, particularly\\ntheir expressive vocabulary skills, after 4 weeks of two dialogic reading sessions per week. Therefore,\\n8 weeks was predicted to be a more than suf\\ufb01cient time period to gain positive results from a similar\\nintervention of two sessions per week.\\nCompliance\\nObservations of each of the interveners were made during the intervention to con\\ufb01rm that the dia-\\nlogic reading techniques were properly administered. For each intervener\\u2019s 10th and 11th sessions, an\\nobserver visited the schools and unobtrusively documented key features of the interactions between\\nthe experimenter and the children in his or her assigned group. Observers looked for the involvement\\nof all children in the sessions, the various types of expansion feedback provided by the interveners to\\ncomplete the children\\u2019s responses, and positive encouragement. Finally, the interveners recorded in a\\nlogbook the date that each book was read, attendance, and any disruptive behaviors that occurred dur-\\ning a session.\\nAlternative treatment group\\nChildren in the alternative treatment group were participating in an early literacy study and re-\\nceived a researcher-developed 8-week phoneme awareness program. This was accomplished through\\nteaching the children how to analyze words into smaller sound segments. Children in this group were\\n\\ufb01rst taught to match pictures based on shared initial and \\ufb01nal sounds (\\ufb01ve words/session) such that\\neach child was given a sheet with a picture of the to-be-matched word along with three other words\\nand the children were asked to circle the pictures that started or ended the same. The children were\\nthen taught a phonemic segmenting task based on Elkonin (1973) \\u2018\\u2018Say It and Move It\\u201d activity. In this\\ntask, children learn to represent each sound within a word by stamping a marker, once for each pho-\\nneme in a word, into squares below a picture of that word.\\nProcedure\\nAt pretest, children were asked to complete the retelling narrative \\ufb01rst and the production narra-\\ntive task second on the short picture books. This was done to ensure optimal performance given the\\nevidence suggesting that the retelling of a previously heard narrative is easier than producing an ori-\\nginal novel narrative ( Hesketh, 2004 ). However, the order of the retelling and production tasks was\\ncounterbalanced on posttest because preliminary analysis of the pretest narratives did not indicate\\nany narrative task difference on pretest. Posttesting occurred during the 2 weeks immediately follow-\\ning the intervention and used the long versions of the picture books.\\nDuring the pretest, the assignment of the two ENNI books to the task was counterbalanced across\\nchildren. Half of the children in the dialogic reading condition were asked to retell the short pool story\\nand to produce a narrative for the short park book, and half were asked to retell the short park story\\nand to produce a novel narrative using the short pool book. The same was done for the alternative\\ntreatment children. This counterbalancing prevented bias on narrative scores based on one book plot10 R. Lever, M. S\\u00e9n\\u00e9chal / Journal of Experimental Child Psychology 108 (2011) 1\\u201324\\nversus another. Order of retelling and production tasks on posttest was counterbalanced within ses-\\nsions as well.\\nDuring the 8-week intervention, two sessions of dialogic reading were held each week in groups of\\ntwo to four children for 20 min. On occasion, absenteeism resulted in dialogic reading sessions con-\\nducted with only one child. However, for the majority of the 8 weeks, all children received the inter-\\nvention in groups of two or more. One book was read per session, and after all eight books were read\\nby the fourth week, they were repeated a second time in the same order. Children in all groups were\\nexposed to the same books. The alternative treatment children also received, in groups of two to four,\\ntheir intervention for 20 min twice a week.\\nResults\\nPreliminary analysis\\nPreliminary analyses of children\\u2019s receptive vocabulary were conducted using the PPVT-III ( Dunn &\\nDunn, 1997 ). No differences in receptive vocabulary scores were found between groups prior to inter-\\nvention ( p= .54). The mean PPVT-III standard scores were 94.86 ( SD= 14.11) for the dialogic reading\\nchildren and 97.47 ( SD= 12.63) for the alternative treatment children. PPVT-III scores were used as a\\ncovariate in subsequent analyses if these scores were related to child outcomes.\\nAlthough all children were tested on all measures, data loss resulted from technical errors with\\nmini-disk recorders during both pretest and posttest. As a result, three children per group were miss-\\ning narrative data on pretest, and another alternative treatment child was missing the retelling nar-\\nrative data on posttest. Given the repeated measures design of the study, all missing data were\\nreplaced using the maximum likelihood estimation as recommended when the amount of data miss-\\ning is large but other raw data from related variables were collected for participants ( McCartney, Bur-\\nchinal, & Bub, 2006 ). Estimated scores for missing data on pretest were based on the children\\u2019s own\\nscores on the PPVT-III and expressive vocabulary. On posttest, the scores for the one child missing\\nthe retelling task were predicted using the maximum likelihood estimation and were based on the\\nchild\\u2019s posttest production narrative scores due to the high correlations between production and\\nretelling narrative scores on posttest ( rs = .32\\u2013.88, p= .05). All means reported within the following\\nsections are calculated with data missing; however, inferential statistics are based on the entire sam-\\nple with missing scores replaced.\\nDependent measures were also analyzed for outliers. One dialogic reading child\\u2019s pretest narratives\\nwere signi\\ufb01cantly lower than those of all other children on story grammar units, thereby qualifying\\nhim as an outlier. However, both of his posttest narratives received scores within 2.58 standard devi-\\nations of the mean ( Tabachnick & Fidell, 2007 ) and were actually higher than some other participants\\u2019\\nnarratives. Therefore, despite variability within groups, no participants were removed based on outlier\\ncriteria.\\nPretest analyses\\nChildren\\u2019s pretest scores on all dependent measures were analyzed with univariate between-par-\\nticipants analyses of variance (ANOVAs) to ensure no group differences prior to intervention on either\\nproduction or retelling narratives. Results revealed no signi\\ufb01cant differences ( ps = .102\\u2013.875) between\\ngroups on measures of structure, language complexity, context, and cohesion on pretest despite super-\\n\\ufb01cial differences in the pretest mean scores that suggested possibly higher scores in the alternative\\ntreatment group as compared with the dialogic reading group (see Table 1 ).\\nPosttest analyses\\nDescriptive statistics for each group for story structure, language complexity, context knowledge,\\nand cohesion (i.e., use of connectives) as a function of narrative tasks are provided in Table 2 .

The production narratives for each child\\nfrom the different treatment groups are discussed because they best demonstrate the effects of the\\nintervention.\\nIntervention effects on story grammar units\\nThe presence of story grammar units in the children\\u2019s narratives was used as a measure of story\\nplot structure. For the production task, children\\u2019s PPVT-III raw scores in addition to pretest story gram-\\nmar total scores were used as covariates due to a signi\\ufb01cant correlation between children\\u2019s receptive\\nvocabulary and narrative structure scores on the production task ( r= .39, p= .014). As predicted, the\\ndialogic reading children had signi\\ufb01cantly higher total story grammar scores than the alternative\\ntreatment group on the production task, F(1, 36) = 5.49, p= .001, d= .38, and the retelling task,\\nF(1, 37) = 3.67, p= .032, d= .28, after controlling for the pretest total story grammar unit scores. In par-\\nticular, the children who received the intervention seemed to include more character mentions, initi-\\nating events ,reactions ,internal responses , and internal plans in both the production and retelling stories\\nthan the children in the control group.\\nTo allow comparisons with previous research ( Zevenbergen et al., 2003 ), follow-up analyses exam-\\nined whether story grammar units that referred to mental states, namely internal responses and inter-\\nnal plans , were improved by the dialogic reading intervention. ANCOVAs for pretest scores revealed\\nthat the dialogic reading children provided signi\\ufb01cantly more internal thought and feeling references\\nin their production narratives, F(1, 36) = 2.85, p= .050, d= .56, as well as in their retelling narratives,\\nF(1, 37) = 6.25, p= .009, d= .77, than alternative treatment children. Given these results, two addi-\\ntional tests were conducted on the remaining story grammar units (the story grammar scores minus\\nthe scores for internal responses and internal plans ) to assess whether the bene\\ufb01ts of dialogic reading\\nwere limited to mental state referents. Using PPVT-III and pretest scores as covariates, the analyses\\nshowed that the dialogic reading children still provided signi\\ufb01cantly more structure to their produc-\\ntion narratives than the alternative treatment children, F(1, 36) = 4.75, p= .018, d= .32, but the effect\\non the retelling posttest was no longer signi\\ufb01cant, F(1, 37) = 2.14, p= .153.\\nIn general, the dialogic reading children included more structure components in their production\\nnarratives than the alternative treatment children. Furthermore, the dialogic reading children men-\\ntioned internal thoughts and emotions more than the alternative treatment children on both the\\nretelling and production tasks. The following excerpt from an alternative treatment child\\u2019s posttest\\nproduction narrative (whole text provided in Appendix B) demonstrates how this group in general de-\\nscribed events that were not chronologically structured or explained through the character\\u2019s internal\\nthoughts or goals:\\nHe had a lot of balloons. Then he said, \\u2018\\u2018Can I have one balloon?\\u201d Then he said, \\u2018\\u2018No.\\u201d Then he said,\\n\\u2018\\u2018No no.\\u201d Then he said, \\u2018\\u2018Okay.\\u201d And then the bunny\\u2019s walking. And then the other bunny was there.\\nAnd the other bunny\\u2019s walking. Then he said, \\u2018\\u2018He didn\\u2019t let me get a balloon.\\u201d Then he said, \\u2018\\u2018Oh\\n\\ufb01rst give the money to him.\\u201d Then they got two balloons.\\nIn the above excerpt, the child was narrating pictures that depicted a character whose attempt to\\npurchase a balloon from a vendor was interrupted because he had no money, so he needed to ask an-\\nother adult to pay for the balloon. However, this logical sequence of events was not decipherable from\\nthe child\\u2019s production. First, she did not explicitly state several key events that are important to the\\ncomprehension of the story such as the main character\\u2019s discovery that he has no money and the adult\\ncharacter providing the money to purchase the balloon. In addition, even the implied events did not\\nappear to be chronological. The narrator\\u2019s failure to properly distinguish the characters or any events\\noutside of the dialogue made it appear that the outcome of the child\\u2019s attempt to buy a balloon is that\\nthe vender \\ufb01rst said \\u2018\\u2018no\\u201d but then said \\u2018\\u2018yes.\\u201d However, shortly after, it was apparent that the maincharacter did not yet get a balloon. Thus, the outcome of the vendor saying \\u2018\\u2018yes\\u201d to a balloon request\\nappeared to have been provided in the middle of the story as opposed to its logical sequential place at\\nthe end. In addition, the child did not explicitly state the character\\u2019s internal motivation for asking for\\na balloon, resulting in the actions seeming random and unexplained.\\nAlternatively, the following excerpt from a dialogic reading child\\u2019s production narrative included\\nmore structural components:R. Lever, M. S\\u00e9n\\u00e9chal / Journal of Experimental Child Psychology 108 (2011) 1\\u201324 13\\nHe saw someone holding balloons from the stash. He wanted one. Then he asked to the man if he\\ncould have one of the red balloons. And he looked on the ground. The man told him \\ufb01ve dollars. He\\nlooked in his pocket. He did not see any. He just got one. And the man said, \\u2018\\u2018Only one red balloon.\\nOnly if you have \\ufb01ve dollars.\\u201d The lady got \\ufb01ve dollars in her little purse and gave it to the man.\\nThen both of the little girl and the little boy has two balloons that were the same color.\\nClearly, all of the events were explicitly stated in this story, including the main character\\u2019s failure to\\n\\ufb01nd money in his pockets. Also, all of the events occurred in logical order such that the overall out-\\ncome of getting the balloons remains at the end of the story. Finally, the dialogic reading child pro-\\nvided more internal motivation details than the alternative treatment child, stating that the main\\ncharacter asked for a balloon because he wanted one.\\nThese two examples illustrate nicely the structural differences in the two production narratives as\\na function of treatment groups. As can be expected, the dialogic reading child\\u2019s entire posttest narra-\\ntive in Appendix B obtained a higher story grammar unit score of 28 of 46, whereas the alternative\\ntreatment child obtained a lower score of 18 of 46.\\nIntervention effects on language complexity\\nThe number of words in the story, the type token ratio, and mean length of utterances were ana-\\nlyzed as measures of language complexity. Pretest scores were used as covariates for all ANCOVAs.\\nContrary to expectations, no signi\\ufb01cant differences were found between groups on any of the language\\ncomplexity measure analyses, with ps ranging from .28 to .97.\\nThe lack of signi\\ufb01cant group differences in language complexity was evident in the example nar-\\nratives. The excerpts below demonstrate that the stories were constructed mainly with short utter-\\nances containing similar noun and verb phrases but lacking descriptive detail:\\nAlternative treatment child: Then he was holding on. Then it \\ufb02ew away. Then there was a string\\npiece.\\nDialogic reading child: She had a balloon. She saw someone come. They said, \\u2018\\u2018Hi.\\u201d And the little girl\\nsaid, \\u2018\\u2018Hi.\\u201d\\nThese short utterances did not actually differ greatly for the children in the two groups. Therefore,\\nalthough the dialogic reading child\\u2019s narratives appeared to be more advanced than the alternative\\ntreatment child\\u2019s narratives, this difference was not due to a richer variety of language or a longer\\nword count.\\nIntervention effects on contextual knowledge\\nNarratives were scored for proper introduction of all \\ufb01rst mentions of characters and objects as an\\nindex of anaphora. During the production task, the dialogic reading children provided references to per-\\nsons and objects that used decontextualized language more appropriately than those provided by the\\nalternative treatment children after controlling for the pretest scores and PPVT-III, F(1, 36) = 3.63,\\np= .032, one-tailed, d= .32. No signi\\ufb01cant difference between groups on anaphora was found on the\\nretelling posttest, F(1, 37) < 1, p= .27.\\nAgain, when analyzing the production narrative of the alternative treatment child, it was evident\\nthat failure to use decontextualized language appropriately was partially responsible for the incom-\\nprehensibility of the text. Noticeably, in this excerpt of a dialogue among several characters (entire\\nnarrative presented in Appendix B), the alternative treatment child continuously referred to all char-\\nacters involved in the conversation as he:\\nHe had a lot of balloons. Then he said, \\u2018\\u2018Can I have one balloon?\\u201d Then he said, \\u2018\\u2018No.\\u201d Then he said,\\n\\u2018\\u2018No no.\\u201d Then he said, \\u2018\\u2018Okay.\\u201d\\nWithout the context of the storybook, the child\\u2019s reference to hethroughout this conversation re-\\nmained unexplained. Who is he? Is the same character responding to himself? Furthermore, although\\nthe alternative treatment child refers to the main character as the doggie at the beginning of the nar-\\nrative, which would normally suf\\ufb01ce as an anaphoric reference to another character (although the\\nshould be replaced by aon the \\ufb01rst introduction), the failure to actually reference this character again14 R. Lever, M. S\\u00e9n\\u00e9chal / Journal of Experimental Child Psychology 108 (2011) 1\\u201324\\nleads one to question whether there actually was a second main character at all. The alternative treat-\\nment child seemed to properly reference the \\ufb01rst mention of objects, with a balloon and two balloons ,\\nbut she did not properly reference the other two characters, stating only the person and the other bunny\\nas if these characters had already been mentioned.\\nThe dialogic reading child, on the other hand, referenced all characters and the main objects of the\\nstory properly, leading to a better contextualized, more coherent story, as demonstrated by the follow-\\ning excerpt:\\nThere was a little girl that has a wagon. She had a balloon. She saw someone come. They said, \\u2018\\u2018Hi.\\u201d\\nAnd the little girl said, \\u2018\\u2018Hi.\\u201d\\nAll participants in this dialogue were clearly identi\\ufb01ed; thus, the conversation was easily\\nunderstood.\\nIntervention effects on cohesion\\nChildren\\u2019s use of connectives such as and,but, and orduring storytelling was used to index story\\ncohesion; in particular, the variety of connectives used within the story was examined as measured\\nby the number of different connectives used. No signi\\ufb01cant differences in the number of different con-\\nnectives used were found between groups on posttest either on the production narrative, F(1, 36) < 1,\\np= .73, or on the retelling narrative, F(1, 37) < 1, p= .89. Both example children demonstrated the\\nproper uses of the independent connective and(to join two independent but related phrases together)\\nor the temporal connective then (to provide a chronological reference of events), as demonstrated\\nwhen the alternative treatment child provided the utterance and then the bunny\\u2019s walking and when\\nthe dialogic reading child provided the utterance and then the little girl\\u2019s still mad. However, both chil-\\ndren did not typically use other connectives. Clearly, the groups did not differ signi\\ufb01cantly on a variety\\nof connectives used. It is possible that children in this sample had not yet learned the proper use of\\nconnectives in general. Alternatively, it is possible that although the children did indeed know how\\nto use complex connectives, they did not use them for this particular task.\\nTreatment \\ufb01delity\\nTo ensure that the intervention was administered as intended, several analyses were performed to\\nassess treatment \\ufb01delity, including the number of intervention sessions attended, the replication of\\npreviously found effects of dialogic reading on expressive vocabulary, and observations of dialogic\\nreading sessions.\\nAttendance\\nAttendance was measured to ensure that all children were receiving enough intervention sessions\\nto assume that any learning occurred as a direct result of dialogic reading. The mean numbers of ses-\\nsions attended were 14.1 ( SD= 1.6) of 16 for the dialogic reading group and 15.1 ( SD= 0.8) of 16 for the\\nalternative treatment group. In both groups, the child who received the fewest number of sessions at-\\ntended 12 sessions. Because every child received at least 75% of the intervention sessions, any\\nimprovement in narrative skills found over and above improvements in the alternative treatment\\ngroup could be assumed to have resulted from the dialogic reading method.\\nIntervention effects on expressive vocabulary\\nPrevious research found that dialogic reading sessions signi\\ufb01cantly enhance children\\u2019s expressive\\nvocabulary (see meta-analysis by Mol et al., 2008 ). A group by testing time repeated measures ANOVA\\nrevealed a Testing Time /C2Group interaction, F(1, 39) = 7.16, p= .001, with an effect size of d= .66. On\\nposttest, the dialogic reading children correctly named, on average, more than 2 of 16 words ( M= 2.42,\\nSD= 1.94), whereas the alternative treatment children provided fewer than 2 of 16 words ( M= 1.37,\\nSD= 0.83), t(1, 38) = \\u20132.21, p= .034. No group differences on expressive vocabulary were found on pre-\\ntest, with means of 1.00 and 0.95 ( SDs = 0.71 and 0.62) for the dialogic reading and alternative treat-\\nment children, respectively.R. Lever, M. S\\u00e9n\\u00e9chal / Journal of Experimental Child Psychology 108 (2011) 1\\u201324 15\\nObservations of dialogic reading sessions\\nThree interveners were responsible for conducting intervention sessions with the children. As such,\\nobservations of two sessions per intervener were scored to ensure similarity of treatments provided.\\nMean scores of the two observations per intervener were analyzed, and results indicated that each\\nchild was providing at least one response to an elaborative question per session and that each child\\naveraged between six and seven responses to questions per session. All three interveners provided\\npraise to the children\\u2019s responses between 78% and 94% of the time. Furthermore, all three interveners\\nexpanded on at least 47% of the children\\u2019s responses and used each one of the four types of expansions\\nat least once per session. In general, interveners used context expansions most often (47\\u201375% of the\\nexpansions observed during the six sessions referenced the characters and objects discussed in spe-\\nci\\ufb01c unambiguous terms) and cohesion expansions least often (18\\u201335% of the 46 expansions observed\\nincluded connectives).\\nAlthough interveners did differ somewhat in their typical elaborations of children\\u2019s responses,\\nthese differences had no signi\\ufb01cant effect on the results of the study. To verify this, between-partic-\\nipants ANOVAs were conducted on dependent measures using intervener as the independent variable.None of these ANOVAs was signi\\ufb01cant. Furthermore, although conversations about the stories may\\nhave differed somewhat, it is important to remember that all questions meant to prompt dialogue\\nwere standardized by including them directly in the text of the storybook. Given the similarities in\\nthe dialogic reading sessions for the intervention groups, the previously presented group differences\\nare considered to be valid effects of the intervention treatment.\\nDisruptive behaviors\\nFully 88% of the children experienced fewer than four sessions during which they or another child\\nin their group engaged in disruptive behaviors. In most cases, the disruptions were inattentiveness\\nthat could be resolved by calling the children\\u2019s attention back to the activity. The number of disrup-\\ntions was not associated with any of the dependent variables except the mean length of utterances\\n(r= .32, p= .05). In this case, the frequency of disruptive behaviors was covaried out of the analysis;\\nhowever, covarying this variable out of the equation did not impact the results.\\nNarrative tasks: Production versus retelling\\nGiven the extant research on narrative knowledge (e.g., Merritt & Liles, 1989; Nelson, 2007 ), addi-\\ntional analyses were conducted to investigate further differences in children\\u2019s performance on produc-\\ntion and retelling tasks. These analyses were collapsed across treatment groups and conducted on the\\nlonger posttest stories. Children\\u2019s posttest performance on story grammar units did differ signi\\ufb01cantly\\nbased on narrative task at posttest, t(1, 39) = /C01.78, p= .042. As indicated in Table 3 , children included\\nsigni\\ufb01cantly more story grammar units for the retelling narratives than for the production narratives.\\nIn fact, they included signi\\ufb01cantly more mental state references on the retelling task than on the pro-\\nduction task, t(1, 39) = /C03.17, p= .002. In addition, children used more words in total on the retelling\\ntask than on the production task at posttest, t(1, 39) = /C01.87, p= .035, and used more contextualized\\nreferences on the retelling task at posttest than on the production task at posttest, t(1, 39) = \\u20132.64,\\np= .012. No other signi\\ufb01cant differences were found.\\nDiscussion\\nOral narrative skills are considered to be essential to young children\\u2019s social communication ( Don-\\nald, 1991 ) and their ability to comprehend and organize event knowledge ( Nelson, 2007 ). Moreover,\\nautobiographical oral narrative skills are assumed to develop in the context of parent\\u2013child conversa-\\ntions ( Peterson et al., 1999 ). The goal of the current study was to test whether adult\\u2013child conversa-\\ntions while reading storybooks would enhance \\ufb01ctional narrative skills. The main hypothesis was that\\nthe biweekly elaborative dialogic reading intervention conducted in small groups over 8 weeks would\\nsigni\\ufb01cantly improve the structure, linguistic complexity, and decontextualized and cohesive nature\\nof children\\u2019s \\ufb01ctional narratives. Our results support the notion that some, but not all, dimensions16 R. Lever, M. S\\u00e9n\\u00e9chal / Journal of Experimental Child Psychology 108 (2011) 1\\u201324\\nof narrative skills are sensitive to dialogic discourse during shared reading. More speci\\ufb01cally, dialogic\\nreading children produced narratives that were better structured and more appropriately decontextu-\\nalized than children who were in the alternative treatment group. The dialogic reading children\\u2019s\\nretelling narratives also included more references to mental states and emotions than the alternative\\ntreatment children\\u2019s retelling narratives, although these structural differences did not extend to other\\nstory grammar units. Contrary to expectations, however, dialogic reading did not affect the complexity\\nof language within the children\\u2019s narratives or their inclusion of cohesive ties. Replicating well-estab-\\nlished \\ufb01ndings ( Mol et al., 2008 ), expressive vocabulary gains were found.\\nThe most important \\ufb01nding of the current study is that interactive shared reading sessions signif-\\nicantly increased children\\u2019s inclusion of structural components in their production and retelling of \\ufb01c-\\ntional narratives. Arguably, the inclusion of a logical structure is considered to be the most important\\ncomponent of a narrative because it allows conveyance of the meaning and plot of the story ( Mandler,\\n1984 ). If one argues that the inclusion of story grammar units is based on schematic information ex-\\ntracted from previous experiences, one could argue that 5-year-olds\\u2019 narrative schemas are incom-\\nplete. Typically developing 5-year-olds can include setting references, initiating events ,attempts , and\\nsometimes outcomes in their constructed narratives, but they do not spontaneously include mentions\\nofinternal responses ,internal plans , and reactions before 8 years of age ( Stein & Glenn, 1979 ). However,\\nafter 8 weeks of dialogic interactions during shared reading, children were able to produce narratives\\nthat included character name mentions, initiating events ,internal responses ,internal plans , and reac-\\ntions , whereas the alternative treatment children did not show this improvement. Therefore, interact-\\ning dialogically in storybook sessions promoted more elaborate story schemas that include internal\\nresponses ,internal plans , and reactions .\\nThere are two reasons why the nature of dialogic reading might bene\\ufb01t this key element of story\\nknowledge above all others. First, the elaborative conversations and questions about stories occur\\nwithin the context of a storybook. These storybooks in the current study were chosen based on the\\nclarity of the plot and demonstration of the plot in the pictures. As such, children were listening to\\na plotted story and answering questions about the story plot while perceiving pictures that demon-\\nstrate plot. Therefore, the context of the picture book reinforced the children\\u2019s awareness of plot ele-\\nments, resulting in this type of intervention highlighting structural knowledge. Second, dialogic\\nreading could impact narrative structure above other dimensions due to the nature of the questions\\nasked to maintain dialogue. Most elaborative questions asked were about speci\\ufb01c events in the stories\\nand, therefore, might highlight the plot despite the attempt to speci\\ufb01cally paste questions in the sto-\\nrybooks that reference all areas of narrative knowledge equally. For example, questions such as \\u2018\\u2018What\\ncolor is Spike after he is splashed by the car?\\u201d were meant to ensure that children acknowledge theTable 3\\nPosttest mean scores and standard deviations on narrative dependent measures as a function of narrative tasks.\\nProduction Retelling\\nVariable MS D MS D\\nStructure\\nStory grammar unit total raw scorea25.43c7.34 26.8c6.16\\nMental state referencesb1.30c1.04 2.00c1.30\\nLanguage complexity\\nNumber of words 187.35c96.86 207.13c100.73\\nType token ratio 0.40 0.09 0.41 0.11Mean length of utterances 6.32 1.30 6.07 1.28\\nContext\\nAnaphora 12.95\\nc1.66 4.05c1.62\\nCohesion\\nConnectives 3.73 3.40 14.23 3.30\\nNote.

However, it is evident that this question was, \\ufb01rst and foremost, related to\\nplot components because it reinforced acknowledgment of an initiating event (a car splashes Spike)\\nand an outcome (Spike is now covered in mud).\\nAlthough story structure improvement was the strongest \\ufb01nding of the current study, another sig-\\nni\\ufb01cant bene\\ufb01t of dialogic reading is improved anaphoric references. Children who received the dia-\\nlogic reading sessions showed a signi\\ufb01cantly better ability to properly contextualize \\ufb01rst mentions of\\ncharacters and objects in their production and retelling narratives, indicating that dialogic reading\\nchildren learned contextual knowledge from the shared reading sessions. Observations of intervention\\nadministration shed light on why this type of intervention might promote contextual knowledge.\\nThese observations, conducted to ensure treatment \\ufb01delity, revealed that when children used an\\nambiguous reference of heorit, the intervener rephrased the response with a more contextualized ref-\\nerence such as a character name or an object label. For example, if the child said, \\u2018\\u2018He is jumping on the\\nbed,\\u201d the intervener would rephrase the statement as \\u2018\\u2018Corduroy is jumping on the bed.\\u201d Because this\\ntype of expansion was the most frequent during the sessions, the dialogic reading children would have\\nhad their ambiguous references \\u2018\\u2018corrected\\u201d often and, therefore, would have been exposed to theimportance of contextual knowledge.\\nOverall, the main \\ufb01nding of this study was that the narrative elements relating to story comprehen-\\nsion were the aspects that were signi\\ufb01cantly affected by dialogic reading. That is, it is necessary for a\\nstory to be chronologically structured and appropriately decontextualized for it to be easily compre-\\nhended. A 5-year-old\\u2019s limited working memory may provide a theoretical explanation for why these\\nelements would be improved \\ufb01rst. Kindergartners might not have the processing capacity that would\\nallow them to attend to all of the components of the story that is read aloud and may be using the\\nmajority of their working memory in an attempt to comprehend the plot of the story, resulting in their\\nattending less to the variety of words and connective ties used (Case, 1991). For this reason, a child\\nmay be attending to story structure and anaphora given that story grammars are considered to be di-\\nrectly related to story comprehension ( Mandler, 1984 ) and decontextualized references aid in action\\nattribution ( Cain, 2003 ). That is, children categorize plot elements into story grammar variables, such\\nas events and outcomes, and can understand the story itself more quickly ( Haberlandt, Berian, & Sand-\\nson, 1980 ). These events and outcomes can be understood only if the characters are clearly distin-\\nguished ( Cain, 2003 ). Because children are attending to structure and anaphora to comprehend the\\nstories themselves, it is logical that they would gain knowledge of how to use these elements \\ufb01rst\\nin the construction of their own stories.\\nAlthough not many studies have investigated the effect of dialogic reading on narrative skills, many\\nhave con\\ufb01rmed that dialogic reading improves children\\u2019s expressive vocabulary ( Mol et al., 2008 ). The\\ncurrent study also found signi\\ufb01cant gains on the expressive measure of book vocabulary. This replica-\\ntion of vocabulary results proves that (a) dialogic reading affects language skills other than narrative\\nability and (b) the study is comparable to past research, suggesting that the intervention itself was\\nconducted in a similar fashion to previous studies.\\nAnother contribution of the current study was the comparison of children\\u2019s performance on narra-\\ntive production and retelling tasks. All children in the sample retold narratives that were signi\\ufb01cantly\\nlonger, were better structured, contained more mental state references, and were signi\\ufb01cantly better\\ndecontextualized than their production narratives. There are several possible explanations for these\\n\\ufb01ndings. The two tasks may have had different performance demands, and the retelling task may have\\nbeen easier than the production task ( Merritt & Liles, 1989 ). When asked to produce a story from a\\npicture book, the number of possible options for story production may have exceeded children\\u2019s work-\\ning memory and hindered their ability to construct narratives that included suf\\ufb01cient elements of all\\ncomponents of narrative knowledge. On the other hand, during the retelling task, children were able\\nto parse from the told story what they thought were the most important structural elements from thepreviously presented script and to reiterate them back to the examiner. Therefore, the retelling tasks\\nmay be easier. This explanation agrees with other comparisons of the production and retelling narra-\\ntive task genres in the literature ( Coelho, 2002; Merritt & Liles, 1989; Trautman, Healey, Brown,\\nBrown, & Jermano, 1999 ).\\nHowever, another more theoretical explanation for these task differences is that children might be\\nshowing competence differences at constructing narratives. That is, the task of producing a story18 R. Lever, M. S\\u00e9n\\u00e9chal / Journal of Experimental Child Psychology 108 (2011) 1\\u201324\\nwithout guidance and the task of retelling one heard previously may require the use of different cog-\\nnitive skills ( Nelson, 2007 ). It is possible that retelling a previously told narrative is more of a story\\ncomprehension task than a construction task ( Mandler, 1984 ). If the retelling task is related to com-\\nprehension, it is possible that simply being able to comprehend the important elements of a story im-\\nproves scores on this task. Most likely, children develop the ability to comprehend what makes a story\\ngood earlier than they are aware of how to construct a good quality \\ufb01ctional narrative ( Nelson, 2007 ),\\nand 5-year-olds do not generalize this knowledge to production tasks. Therefore, when a child is com-\\npleting a retelling task, the child\\u2019s comprehension of what elements of the story are important would\\nallow him or her to retell the narrative with details that include character motivations and evaluative\\ndetail. However, when a child is completing a production narrative, the child\\u2019s schema for construct-\\ning a \\ufb01ctional narrative from scratch might not yet include elements such as characters thoughts and\\nmay be limited to only plot details. For example, Trautman et al. (1999) found that emotional or men-\\ntal state references are not as common in novel \\ufb01ctional narratives as they are in retellings of previ-\\nously heard stories. Because Trautman and colleagues were referring to older children (6\\u201312 years of\\nage), this provides evidence that the 5-year-olds in the current study may be too young to refer fre-quently to mental states within their \\ufb01ctional stories.\\nInterestingly, this theoretical explanation is consistent with the \\ufb01ndings of a correlational study\\nthat found links between oral narrative constructions and later literacy skills ( Grif\\ufb01n et al., 2004 ).\\nThe produced narratives of 5-year-olds were correlated with the written narrative productions and\\nreading comprehension scores of the same children at 8 years of age, but the written productions\\nof 8-year-olds were not related to their concurrent reading comprehension scores. Most interesting,\\ncertain components of the oral productions were differentially related to written production and read-\\ning comprehension. Speci\\ufb01cally, the inclusion of character mental state references in oral narratives at\\n5 years of age was related to reading comprehension at 8 years of age, whereas the inclusion of plot\\nand structural elements at 5 years of age was related to written narrative productions. This pattern of\\n\\ufb01ndings may shed light on the \\ufb01ndings of the current study. If one agrees that story retelling is more\\nclosely a story comprehension task, it is not surprising that it is the inclusion of mental state refer-\\nences that was most affected by dialogic reading for this task. Similarly, if narrative production tasks\\nrequire the activation of readily available story schemas, it is not surprising that it is the overall inclu-\\nsion of structural elements that was improved by dialogic reading.\\nSome limitations of the current study are noteworthy. For one, the effect of dialogic reading on nar-\\nrative skills was modest, with effect sizes ranging from d= .28 to d= .77. Clearly, larger effect sizes\\nwould be bene\\ufb01cial. The failure to \\ufb01nd larger effect sizes likely is due to the amount of variability\\nof children\\u2019s narrative skills represented in this sample. This variability may be due to the variety\\nin socioeconomic backgrounds of the participating children. Tighter controls and less variability in\\ngroups might raise effect sizes. Furthermore, increasing the length or frequency of sessions might also\\nraise effect sizes given that sessions held twice a week for 8 weeks might not be enough for children to\\nfully internalize their new knowledge about narratives.\\nAnother limitation to this study is that it does not allow us to integrate the research on children\\u2019s\\nknowledge of autobiographical and \\ufb01ctional narratives. The \\ufb01ndings obtained suggest that change in\\nnarrative knowledge can occur in a relatively short period of time, but intervention research on auto-\\nbiographical narratives with low-SES children would suggest that changes in narrative knowledge do\\nnot occur as quickly ( Peterson et al., 1999 ). Whether autobiographical narrative knowledge and \\ufb01c-\\ntional narrative knowledge are acquired at the same rate, whether they are in\\ufb02uenced by the same\\ntypes of interactions, and whether \\ufb01ctional narrative knowledge builds on children\\u2019s already devel-\\noped autobiographical narrative knowledge are critical questions that will need to be addressed in fu-\\nture research. The very limited and preliminary research suggests that there may be fundamental\\ndifferences between the two types of knowledge. S\\u00e9n\\u00e9chal et al. (2008) did not \\ufb01nd a relation between\\nchildren\\u2019s performance on an autobiographical story task and a \\ufb01ctional story task based on a wordless\\nbook prompt. Future studies are necessary to investigate whether children\\u2019s ability to tell autobio-\\ngraphical stories and \\ufb01ctional stories re\\ufb02ects an overarching story schema.\\nYoung children gain narrative construction knowledge from elaborative event conversations with\\nlearned adults ( Peterson et al., 1999 ). However, most research on this topic has focused on event\\nconversations that reference personal memories experienced by either adults or children. AlthoughR. Lever, M. S\\u00e9n\\u00e9chal / Journal of Experimental Child Psychology 108 (2011) 1\\u201324 19\\nnarrative construction knowledge has previously been linked to reading and storybook experience\\nthrough correlational research ( Grif\\ufb01n et al., 2004; O\\u2019Neill et al., 2004 ), few studies have demonstrated\\nthat oral \\ufb01ctional storytelling skills could be improved by shared reading experiences. By expanding\\nthe current literature on dialogic reading and narratives ( Zevenbergen et al., 2003 ), the current re-\\nsearch contributes to the \\ufb01eld by demonstrating that elaborative story conversations in the context\\nof storybooks can improve children\\u2019s \\ufb01ctional oral story construction.\\nAppendix A.

Dialogic reading, preschool, community health centers,\\nshared book reading, video training\\nINTRODUCTION\\nShared book reading is a way that children can acquire important\\npre-reading skills, including vocabulary knowledge, awareness of print,\\nand story structures (Snow, Burns, & Griffin, 1998). By engaging chil-dren in shared book reading, families can play a critical role in prepar-\\ning children to learn to read. Dialogic reading (DR) is an evidence-\\nbased approach to shared book reading that has been described andextensively documented by Whitehurst and colleagues (e.g., Arnold,\\nLonigan, Whitehurst, & Epstein, 1994; Lonigan & Whitehurst, 1998;\\nWhitehurst, Arnold et al., 1994a; Whitehurst, Epstein et al., 1994;Whitehurst et al., 1988, 1999). The main goal of dialogic reading is forthe child to become the storyteller and for the adult to facilitate, expand\\nand respond to the child\\u2019s verbalizations. DR involves strategies to\\nengage a child actively during story time so he/she can practice usinglanguage and receive adult feedback. Research by Whitehurst and hiscolleagues clearly demonstrates that these adult-child interactions in the\\ncontext of picture book reading facilitate young children\\u2019s language\\ndevelopment. For a comprehensive review of the DR literature and adescription of the facilitating strategies, readers are directed to Zeven -\\nbergen and Whitehurst (2003). Types and definitions of DR strategiesare also provided in Appendix.118 JOURNAL OF APPLIED SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGY\\nVideo-Based Instruction of DR Strategies\\nStudies by Whitehurst and colleagues (Whitehurst, 1991; Whitehurst\\net al., 1994a,b) provide evidence for the benefits of DR on expressive\\nlanguage in preschoolers and emergent literacy skills at the end of kinder -\\ngarten. Recently, Whitehurst collaborated with Pearson Early Learning\\npublishing company to develop a video-based training program designed\\nto teach adults to use DR strategies. Read Together, Talk Together\\n(RTTT ; Pearson Early Learning, 2002) is a commercially available,\\n15-minute video-based instructional program for parents and teachers.\\nThere are several advantages for using a video-based training pro -\\ngram to teach parents to use DR strategies. First, the purpose of thevideo is to teach or encourage skills that the parent may or may not have\\nin his/her repertoire. Based on observational learning theory (Bandura,\\n1986), parents and teachers may learn DR strategies better if they canview other people similar to themselves modeling the target behavior(Zevenbergen & Whitehurst, 2003). Additional advantages to using a\\nvideo to train parents in DR procedures include cost efficiency, trainer\\ntime efficiency, and consistency in intervention delivery (Blom-Hoff-man et al., in press). These key factors are helpful in facilitating the dis-\\nsemination of DR strategies to families with children at risk for reading\\ndifficulties.\\nVideo-Based Parent Training\\nVideo-based instructions have been used to teach a variety of skills to\\nparents. Webster-Stratton conducted a series of studies (1981a,b; 1982)\\nin which she developed and evaluated the use of a group-based parent\\ntraining program that included videotaped vignettes and a discussionformat. These initial studies were conducted with well-educated and non-\\nclinical samples. Subsequently, Webster-Stratton (1984) conducted a\\nstudy that investigated the short- and long-term effectiveness of this\\nvideo-based training compared with individualized therapy that usedfeedback, rehearsal, and live modeling, and an untreated control groupwith low-income parents of children with clinically significant behavior\\nchallenges. At immediate posttest assessment, parents in both treatment\\ngroups showed significant improvements in attitudes and behaviorwhen compared with parents in an untreated control group. Children in\\nboth treatment groups showed a decrease in deviant and non-compliant\\nbehavior; however, such changes did not reach significance. At the1-year follow-up, attitudinal and behavioral changes in parents andBlom-Hoffman et al. 119\\nchildren were maintained in both treatment groups. Moreover, although\\nchanges in child\\u2019s non-compliance and deviant behavior was of border -\\nline significance at immediate posttest, these behaviors showed a con -\\ntinued decline at the 1-year follow-up, Results indicated that a video-based training program with a discussion group was an effective tool inteaching parenting skills. While both training methods were effective,\\nthe cost effectiveness of video-based training compared with the expen -\\nsive individualized one-to-one training allow for cost-effective, large-\\nscale dissemination.\\nMore recently, Bradley et al. (2003) used a randomized control group\\ndesign to investigate the ability of the 1-2-3 Magic (Phelan, 1990) video\\nto teach parenting skills in a community agency to parents of preschool -\\ners who were experiencing difficulties managing their children\\u2019s be -\\nhavior. Parent-child dyads were randomly assigned to an experimentalgroup, which viewed the 1-2-3 Magic video or to a wait-list control\\ngroup. Child behavior (e.g., aggression, anxiety, hyperactivity), par-enting behavior (e.g., anger, irritability, failure to enforce rules), current\\nlevel of parental stress, and child temperament (e.g., difficultness) were\\nassessed via parent report three months later. Consistent with Webster-Stratton\\u2019s findings, Bradley et al.\\u2019s (2003) study supported video-based\\ninstruction as an effective tool to teach parents effective parenting strat-\\negies. Parents in the intervention group reported decreases in their child\\u2019soverall problematic behavior, hyperactivity and distractibility. Further-more, parents who received intervention reported significant changes to\\ntheir child\\u2019s temperament including decreased rates of persistence, neg-\\native adaptation and affect, and degree of difficulty. Moreover, parentswho received video-based instruction perceived their children as more\\ncompliant and happier.\\nPurpose of This Study\\nThere were two main purposes of this study. First, we were interested\\nin examining the effect of the RTTT video on caregivers\\u2019 use of dialogic\\nreading behaviors when reading with their children. It was hypothesized\\nthat caregivers, who viewed the video, would increase their use of DR\\nstrategies when reading with their children compared with (1) their use of\\nDR strategies before viewing the video; and (2) caregivers who did notview the video. In addition, it was hypothesized that the increased level of\\nDR strategy use would be maintained at a 12-week follow-up. The sec -\\nond purpose of this study was to examine the effect of the parent trainingon children\\u2019s verbalizations during shared book reading. Specifically, we120 JOURNAL OF APPLIED SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGY\\nhypothesized that children whose parent viewed the video would engage\\nin higher levels of verbalizations during shared book reading comparedwith (1) their verbalizations during shared book reading before their par -\\nent viewed the video; and (2) the verbalizations of children whose parents\\ndid not view the video. In addition, we hypothesized that the improve -\\nments would be maintained at a 12-week follow-up.\\nFrom the literature conducted in the area of DR, it is clear that using\\nDR strategies when reading with young children is associated with im -\\nproved oral language skills. The present study is unique in that it is thefirst to examine the effects of the commercially available RTTT video\\non parents\\u2019 reading behaviors. In addition, this study is important be -\\ncause it examined the use of video-based parent training to promotechild development in the waiting room of community health centers(CHCs), a venue not previously investigated, yet important given the\\ntime that parents spend in this environment with their young children.\\nMETHOD\\nParticipants\\nEighteen parent-child dyads, who received their primary health care\\nat CHCs, participated in this study. Due to the relatively small sample\\nsize of this study, which would not be able to take into account the ef-\\nfects of account language differences, families were required to speak\\nEnglish as their primary language to be included in this preliminary in-vestigation. Families were recruited for the study through targeted mail -\\nings, phone calls, and through fliers posted on the walls of the CHCs.\\nParent-child dyads were randomly assigned to an experimental ( N=8 )\\nand control (N = 10) group. Demographic information describing the\\nfamilies is presented in Table 1.\\nSetting and Intervention\\nThis study was conducted at two CHCs in an urban setting in the\\nNortheast. Both CHCs provide primary care to large numbers of ethni -\\ncally and racially diverse families with and without health insurance.\\nCaregivers in the experimental group viewed the 15-minute RTTT\\ndialogic training video (Pearson Early Learning, 2002) on a TV/VCR in\\nthe waiting room of the CHC. The video included a description of the\\ndialogic reading strategies as well as modeling of the various strategies.Blom-Hoffman et al. 121\\nPlease refer to Blom-Hoffman et al. (in press) for a more comprehen-\\nsive description of the RTTT video.\\nProcedures and Materials\\nCaregiver-child participation in this study involved three visits to the\\nCHC during regular clinic hours. Regardless of group assignment, sub-jects\\u2019 baseline assessmen ts during the first visit were the same. All care-giver-child dyads participated in a five-minute, videotaped observation.Caregivers were instructed \\u201cto read together with your child as you do athome.\\u201d Following the observation, the caregivers were asked to reporthow similar the videotaped observation was to reading together at home.\\nFollowing baseline assessment, caregivers in the experimental group\\nviewed the RTTT video. In addition, they were provided with a lami -\\nnated handout and bookmark, developed by the first author that high -\\nlighted and summarized key points in the video. Caregivers in the\\ncontrol group did not view the video. Instead, they received a generic\\nbookmark entitled, \\u201c 7 Super Things Parents and Caregivers Can Do \\u201d\\n(Early Childhood-Head Start Taskforce & U.S. Department of Educa -\\ntion & U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, n.d.). All chil -\\ndren, regardless of group assignment, received three books at the end of\\nthe first visit.\\nImmediately after viewing the videotape, caregivers in the experimental\\ngroup completed a modified version of the Intervention Rating Profile122 JOURNAL OF APPLIED SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGY\\nTABLE 1.  Caregiver and Child Descriptive Information\\nExperimental Group ( N= 8) Control Group ( N= 10)\\nChild (age in months) M= 44.5; SD= 9.2 M= 37.2; SD= 8.0\\nRace/Ethnicity (%)\\nAsian or Pacific Islander 12.5 0\\nBlack, not Latino/Latina 37.5 30\\nWhite, not Latino/Latina 50 70\\nCaregiver Education Level (%)\\nSome high school (didn\\u2019t finish) 12.5 0\\nHigh school degree 12.5 20\\nSome college or trade school 37.5 60\\n4-year college degree 12.5 10\\nCollege /H11001 25 10\\n(IRP; Martens & Witt, 1982). The seven-item, modified IRP was adminis -\\ntered to assess caregiver acceptability of the videotape and DR strategies.\\nCaregiver acceptability of the videotaped training program, determined\\nto be high, is described elsewhere (Blom-Hoffman et al., in press).\\nThe second and third visits occurred approximately 6 and 12 weeks,\\nrespectively, following the first visit. Five-minute videotaped observa -\\ntions of parent-child reading interactions were conducted using the\\nsame procedures as before. At the end of both of these visits, caregiversreceived a monetary stipend, and children received another book.\\nData Coding\\nTwo school psychology graduate students transcribed the videotaped\\nobservations. Subsequently, they were trained to observe parent behav -\\niors using a code that included seven DR prompts plus an additional\\nprompt called \\u201cattending\\u201d statements (see Appendix). Once the observ-ers reached a predetermined 90% level of agreement for each behavior,\\nthey independently coded the parent statements from the transcriptions.\\nAfter coding the caregiver statements, they summed each category toyield a frequency count for each of the eight prompt categories. Finally,\\nthe observers summed the frequencies from all the eight DR categories\\ninto a general category called \\u201cfacilitating verbalizations.\\u201d\\nTo assess child verbalizing behaviors during each reading obser-\\nvation, a third research assistant, who is a school psychologist, used a\\n10-second partial interval recording procedure to code on- and off-task\\nverbalizations. On-task verbalizations were defined as child commentsabout something related to the book, including answers to questionsposed by the caregiver and questions asked about the book. Off-task\\nverbalizations included comments and questions that were not related to\\nthe book (e.g., \\u201cI want juice\\u201d) and responses to caregiver questions thatwere not related to the book (e.g, \\u201cno,\\u201d when asked if he/she had to go to\\nthe bathroom). Once the research assistant reached a predetermined\\nlevel of inter-observer agreement with the first author (i.e., 90% agree -\\nment) the research assistant independently coded the videotapes.\\nRESULTS\\nIn general, parents reported that the reading observations in the clinic\\nwere quite (i.e., 56%) or somewhat (i.e., 33%) similar to when they read\\nwith their child at home. Following a minority of the observations (11%),Blom-Hoffman et al. 123\\nparents reported that the reading observations were not similar to when\\nthey read with their child at home. Reasons for lack of similarity included\\nreading location (i.e., sitting in a chair in the health center as opposed to\\nlying on their child\\u2019s bed) and distraction from the video camera.\\nParent Verbalizations During Shared Book Reading\\nTo assess inter-rater agreement, two trained research assistants inde -\\npendently coded 26% of all transcripts of videotaped reading observa -\\ntions. For each parent statement, each research assistant coded 1 of 8\\nparent facilitating verbalizations. Total inter-rater agreement [agree -\\nments/(agreements /H11001disagreements) * 100] was calculated for each\\ncategory. Inter-rater agreement was good for all categories ( = 97.8%;\\nrange between 91.6% and 100%).\\nOf the 18 cases studied, 4 (i.e., 2 experimental and 2 control dyads)\\nhad one missing videotape observation data point due to a missed ap-pointment. In other words, 7% of the videotaped observations were\\nmissing from the data set. These data were replaced with group means.\\nFigure 1 displays combined parent facilitating behaviors for the treat-\\nment and control group over the three measurement occasions (pre-124 JOURNAL OF APPLIED SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGY\\nFIGURE 1.

First,\\nwe assessed differences between groups at each time point using Co -\\nhen\\u2019s dfrom t-tests (Thalheimer & Cook, 2002). Magnitudes of effects\\nwere assessed using Cohen\\u2019s (1992) criteria wherein the magnitude ofeffect sizes (ES ) can be categorized as small (between .15 and .40),\\nmoderate (between .40 and .75), or large (>.75). Results indicate no dif -\\nference between the experimental (\\n= 17.63;S D= 8.75) and control\\n(= 17.93;S D= 10.68) groups at pre-treatment ( ES= .03). However, a\\nlarge effect (ES = 2.26) as a function of intervention was noted at the\\n6-week follow-up, where parent facilitating verbalizations in the exper -\\nimental group demonstrated nearly a twofold increase from pre-treat -\\nment ( = 32.27;S D= 9.4) compared with a small decrease in the\\ncontrol group ( = 16.15;S D = 6.78). This large effect remained rela -\\ntively stable at the 12-week follow-up ( ES= 1.36). Here parents in the\\nexperimental group maintained relatively high levels of facilitating ver-balizations (\\n= 30.51;S D= 14) compared with low and stable verbal-\\nizations for control group parents ( = 14.52 ; SD = 11.22).\\nThe effect of the videotape intervention on parents\\u2019 use of specific DR\\nstrategies was also assessed. Results indicated that certain types ofprompts were used more frequently by parents who viewed the video,while others were utilized infrequently by parents in both groups. Specifi-\\ncally, at the second visit, parents who viewed the RTTT video used more\\npage prompts (e.g., wh-type questions;\\n= 18.46; SD= 8.95) than care-\\ngivers who did not received the video-based training ( = 6.75; SD=\\n5.32). Furthermore, parents who viewed the video showed a greater useof evaluation prompts (\\n= 6.66; SD= 3.4) compared with those who did\\nnot receive the video training ( = 2.62; SD= 2.11). Other DR strategies,\\nhowever, such as expansion, repetition, recall and distancing promptswere used infrequently by caregivers in both groups across sessions. It is\\nimportant to note that wh-/open-ended questions (i.e., page prompts) andevaluation prompts are interdependent; in other words, if a parent asks\\nmore wh-type questions and the child responds, there are more opportu -\\nnities for the parent to evaluate the child\\u2019s response.\\nChild Verbalizations During Shared Book Reading\\nA trained research assistant and the first author independently coded\\n20% of the videotaped reading observations. Total inter-rater agree -\\nment [agreements/(agreements /H11001disagreements) * 100] was calculated\\nfor each category. Inter-rater agreement was good for observations ofBlom-Hoffman et al. 125\\non-task ( = 95%; Range = 87-100%) and off-task behavior ( = 99%;\\nRange = 93-100%).\\nFigure 2 displays experimental and control group children\\u2019s on-task\\nverbalizations at three points in time (i.e., pre-treatment, 6 weeks post-\\ntreatment, and 12 weeks post-treatment). Differences between groups at\\neach time point were assessed using Cohen\\u2019s dfrom t-tests (Thalheimer &\\nCook, 2002). At pre-treatment, there was no difference between the ex -\\nperimental ( = 28.24;S D= 22.86) and control ( /H9273= 32.7 ;S D= 22.61)\\ngroups with regard to child on-task verbalizations ( ES=/H11002.021). How -\\never, at the 6-week follow-up, a large effect ( ES= .78) as a function of\\nintervention was noted. Experimental group children\\u2019s on-task verbal -\\nizations increased ( =39.42;S D= 20.67) and control group children\\u2019s\\non-task verbalizations remained at a level similar to that observed during\\nthe first visit (/H9273 = 25.4;S D = 17.96). At the 12-week follow-up, a very\\nlarge effect as a result of the intervention was noted ( ES= 1.26). Here\\nchildren in the experimental group showed nearly a twofold increase\\nrelative to pre-treatment in their levels of on-task verbalizations ( =\\n50.36;S D= 18.39) compared with much lower levels of on-task verbal-\\nizations from children in the control group ( = 28.11;S D= 19.02).\\nLevels of off-task verbalizations during shared book reading were low\\nin both groups and during each of the three visits (e.g., 3-15%).126 JOURNAL OF APPLIED SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGY\\nFIGURE 2. Percentage of Child On-Task Verbalizations During Shared Book\\nReading.\\nDISCUSSION\\nSummary of Findings\\nDialogic reading (DR) strategies have been found to facilitate the de -\\nvelopment of oral language and emergent literacy skills in toddlers and\\npreschool age children at home, school, and daycare settings (e.g.,\\nArnold, Lonigan, Whitehurst, & Epstein, 1994; Lonigan & Whitehurst,1998; Whitehurst, Arnold, Epstein, Angell, Smith, & Fischel, 1994;\\nWhitehurst, Epstein, Angell, Payne, Crone, & Fischel, 1994; White -\\nhurst, Zevenbergen, Crone, Schultz, Velting, & Fischel, 1999; White -\\nhurst et al., 1988). In these settings, caregiver training to use DR\\nstrategies with young children has been successfully provided \\u201clive\\u201d\\nand via videotape (Arnold et al., 1994; Whitehurst et al., 1988, 1994a,b,\\n1999). In the current study, caregivers in CHCs learned to use DR strat-egies through videotape training, and they maintained their use of DRstrategies when reading with their preschool children 12 weeks later.\\nAlso, children\\u2019s levels of on-task verbalizations increased when their\\nparents engaged them using DR strategies during shared book reading.These results reinforce the use of videotape-based DR training to\\ncaregivers, and they promote such caregiver training in CHCs.\\nParents spend a great deal of time in CHCs with their young children.\\nFor example, parents bring their preschool-aged children to CHCs for\\nwellness visits and for visits related to illness (e.g., of the parent, the\\npreschool child, and/or a younger or older sibling). Often families arrive\\nfor appointments at CHCs early; sometimes health care professionalsare unavoidably running late. In both cases, families pass time in health\\ncare center waiting areas, creating a valuable opportunity for them to\\nlearn strategies they can use to facilitate their children\\u2019s languagedevelopment when reading to their children.\\nIn addition to being an ideal environment for training parents to use\\nstrategies to facilitate aspects of their children\\u2019s language development,CHCs are also a highly acceptable environment for the provision of thistraining. As described elsewhere, provision of a videotape-based DRtraining program to parents in the waiting areas of the two CHCs where\\nthis study was conducted was judged as being highly acceptable to the\\ncaregivers who participated in this study and to the staff at the twocenters (Blom-Hoffman et al., in press).\\nUse of video-based training in general has definite advantages. These\\ninclude standardization of the targeted intervention (i.e., information isprovided consistently) and cost effectiveness from personnel and timeBlom-Hoffman et al. 127\\nperspectives (i.e., staff do not have to be physically present to provide\\ntraining). An advantage of the DR videotape in particular is that it pro -\\nvides multiple examples of parents reading to their children using theDR strategies being taught (Arnold et al., 1994). From a learning theoryperspective, such observational methods are highly e ffective in teaching\\ntarget behaviors (Bandura, 1986).\\nLimitations\\nThe findings of this study are best viewed as preliminary due to the\\nlimited sample size in terms of parent-child dyads and CHCs. Future\\nstudies with larger samples of diverse parents, children and CHCs willelucidate the degree to which these findings generalize to other popula -\\ntions and settings.\\nAn additional limitation involves the potential for parent and child\\nreactivity to being videotaped. Parents and children knew that they werebeing observed while reading together; therefore, the improvements in\\nparents\\u2019 use of the reading strategies may have been limited to the vid-\\neotaped clinic session. We attempted to measure this by asking the par-ents to report how similar the observation was to their typical reading at\\nhome. Most of the time (i.e., 89%) parents reported that the observa-\\ntions were quite or somewhat similar to their typical reading interac-tions at home. However, it is unclear to what degree the behaviorchanges observed in the experimental group generalized to interactions\\nat home.\\nDirections for Future Research\\nDetermining that caregivers in CHCs can learn and maintain their use\\nof DR strategies from a commercially available training video is an\\nimportant step. Despite the fact that the parents\\u2019 overall use of DR strat -\\negies increased, the increase was related to their use of two of the strate -\\ngies in particular (i.e., page prompts and evaluation prompts). The nextstep is to determine how to encourage parents to learn to use some of theDR strategies which our data indicate they did not use before or after\\nviewing the video. Some of these strategies, such as expansion, recall,\\nand repetition, may have been less familiar to the parents, and they mayneed additional instruction and feedback beyond that provided in the\\nvideo to use them. In addition, it will be important to examine the viabil -\\nity of this intervention with other groups, such as families who do notspeak English as their primary language, and with children with lan -128 JOURNAL OF APPLIED SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGY\\nguage delays. The ability of this video when shown in other settings\\nwhere parents spend time (e.g., at home, in homeless shelters, during\\nparent nights at preschool) to alter parent reading behaviors should be\\nexamined as well.\\nThis study contributes to the DR literature by providing initial sup -\\nport for the use of the RTTT video in helping parents learn DR strate -\\ngies. It is impressive that a short video shown only at one time andwithout discussion or feedback has the ability to change parent readingbehaviors and rates of task-specific child verbalizations during shared\\nbook reading and that these changes are maintained over time. In addi -\\ntion, this study demonstrated the delivery of this type instruction to par -\\nents in a novel setting where parents bring their children.\\nDirections for Practice\\nIt is important for school psychologists to be familiar with DR, as an\\nevidence-based literacy promotion practice. Given their roles as consul-\\ntants and trainers it is important to be aware of materials available to dis-\\nseminate these strategies to preschool teachers and to parents of youngchildren. The results of this pilot study investigating the effects of RTTT\\non parent and child behaviors during shared book reading indicate thatthis video is associated with increases in some parent facilitating strate-gies and child task related verbalizations. Using information from thisstudy and other sources of information about DR (e.g., Zevenbergen &\\nWhitehurst, 2003) school psychologists and their educator colleagues\\ncan facilitate a training program for family members with young chil-dren regarding the importance of shared book reading and the use of\\nDR strategies. This type of training program can be conducted in pre -\\nschools, libraries, churches, and other community centers where parentsspend time. The RTTT video can be shown to parents, followed by op -\\nportunities for parents to practice the strategies and to receive feedback\\nfrom facilitators. In addition, families can be given a bookmark or hand -\\nout of helpful hints to take home as a reminder of important DR strate -\\ngies. To reach parents whose schedules do not permit them to attend thistype of training program, school psychologists and teachers can preparereader-friendly information that can be sent home to families about DR\\nand can make available the RTTT videotape for families to borrow to\\nview at home. DR is an evidence-based approach to engage young chil -\\ndren in shared book reading. School psychologists and our educator\\ncolleagues can play an important role in disseminating informationabout DR to caregivers.Blom-Hoffman et al. 129\\nREFERENCES\\nArnold, D. H., Lonigan, C.

This type of statement does not require averbal response from the child. (e.g., \\u201clook at the . . .\\u201d).\\nEvaluating Prompt Parent evaluates what the child says by praising the child, re -\\npeating what the child says, or gently correcting the child\\u2019s\\nanswer.\\nExpanding Prompt Parent expands on the child\\u2019s response by giving more\\ninformation.\\nRepeat Prompt Parent has the child repeat the correct response.\\nCompletion Prompt Parent begins a sentence and pauses, intonates or explicitly\\nrequests that the child will fill in the words. This is typically usedwith repetitive text and highly probable phrases.\\nRecall Prompt Parent asks the child to remember a detail from the story that is\\nnot on the current page.\\nDistancing Prompt Parent asks questions or offers statements that encourage the\\nchild to connect something in the book to his/her life.\\nNote: The code was developed based on the operational definitions of DR strategies in Zevenbergen and\\nWhitehurst (2003).\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"allocation_labels\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1,\n          0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"experimenter_labels\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": -1,\n        \"max\": 3,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1,\n          -1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

The participants\\nwere 67 children enrolled in the second level of kindergarten (ages 5\\u20136), assigned\\nto an experimental group ( n\\u00bc35) or a control group ( n\\u00bc32). Kindergarten\\nInventory of Phonological Awareness was developed by the author in the light of\\nrelevant previous studies. Pre-tests and post-tests were administered to the\\nparticipants in the two groups. In between the two tests, the experimental groupengaged in DR activities designed to improve their phonological awareness skills,\\nusing an alphabet storybook, designed and developed by the author, presented to\\nthe whole class via PowerPoint, while the control group participated in regular\\nclassroom activities. The \\ufb01ndings suggest that children in the experimental group\\nhad higher phonological awareness levels in the post-tests than those in thecontrol group. The speci\\ufb01c design of the DR activities may be responsible for\\nthese changes.\\nKeywords: phonological awareness; dialogic reading; Egyptian kindergarteners\\nIntroduction\\nPromoting the awareness of language sounds or phonological awareness is one of the\\ngoals of Arabic language arts curriculum according to the National Standards Docu-\\nment for Kindergarten in Egypt (Ministry of Education, 2008). However, there has\\nbeen little attention paid to include phonological awareness of Arabic language in lit-\\neracy activities. There is a lack of information on how to plan and implement activitiesusing interactive techniques of shared reading, such as dialogic reading (DR), that could\\nhelp promote children\\u2019s phonological awareness skills. The review of Egyptian studies\\nthat have examined promoting phonological awareness of kindergarteners (Farahat,2011; Labib, 2010; Osman, 2009) and that have examined the effects of speci\\ufb01c\\nbook-reading techniques on their learning (Abdel Kareem, 2004; Abou-Elyazeed,\\n2003) shows a lack of Egyptian research into teaching Arabic phonological awarenessusing DR. In addition, studies that have examined the effect of interactive shared\\nreading or DR on the promotion of phonological awareness in preschool and kindergar-\\nten classrooms have been carried out in western countries with native speakers ofwestern languages. None of these previous studies have used alphabet storybooks\\n#2013 Taylor & Francis\\u2217Email: randa_abdelaleem@edu.suez.edu.egEarly Child Development and Care , 2013\\nVol. 183, No. 9, 1229\\u20131241, http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03004430.2012.703183\\n\\n(a combination of children\\u2019s storybooks and alphabet books) as reading materials that\\nmay represent valuable DR materials for promoting phonological awareness, by\\nproviding meaningful stories that elicit talk about letters and sounds and allowing\\nthe use of sound-focused prompts during the reading of storybooks. Presenting thesereading materials via PowerPoint has many features to facilitate promoting phonologi-\\ncal awareness skills of young children (Parette, Hourcade, Boeckmann, & Blum, 2008).\\nTherefore, the purpose of the present study was to examine the possibility of promotingArabic phonological awareness through DR techniques embedded in whole-class\\nliteracy activities for kindergarten children, using an alphabet storybook as the\\nreading material presented via PowerPoint. This type of teaching could help Egyptiankindergarten teachers overcome the problem of the large number of children in\\nkindergarten classrooms, allow the whole-class interactions, and extend children\\nparticipation.\\nPhonological awareness\\nPhonological awareness refers to \\u2018the ability to detect or manipulate the sound structure\\nof oral language\\u2019 (Lonigan, 2006, p. 78). The general sequence of phonological aware-\\nness development, as identi\\ufb01ed by the research \\ufb01ndings (Anthony & Francis, 2005;Anthony, Lonigan, Driscoll, Phillips, & Burgess, 2003), emphasised that, \\ufb01rst, children\\ncan detect or manipulate syllables before they can detect or manipulate onsets and rimes\\n(rhymes) and they can detect or manipulate onsets and rimes before they can detect ormanipulate individual phonemes. Second, children can detect similar-sounding and dis-\\nsimilar-sounding words before they can manipulate sounds within words, and children\\ncan generally blend phonological information before they can segment phonologicalinformation of the same linguistic complexity. Finally, children re\\ufb01ne phonological\\nawareness skills that they have already acquired while they are learning new phonolo-\\ngical awareness skills.\\nThe research \\ufb01ndings emphasised the relationship between young children\\u2019s\\nphonological awareness and success in r eading and spelling (Cardoso-Martins,\\nMesquita, & Ehri, 2011; Catts & Little, 2005; Chow, McBride-Chang, & Burgess,2005; Giambo & Mckinney, 2004; Kim, Petscher, Foorman, & Zhou, 2010; Sliva\\n& Martins, 2003). The research \\ufb01ndings also emphasised the value of children\\u2019s\\nlevel of phonological awareness at the end of kindergarten as one of the strongestpredictors of future reading success in the early grades (Hogan, Catts, & Little, 2005;\\nKjeldsen, Niemib, & Olofsson, 2003; Poe, Burchinal, & Roberts, 2004; Roth, Speece,\\n& Cooper, 2002).\\nThe National Standards Document for Kindergarten in Egypt has identi\\ufb01ed phono-\\nlogical awareness indicators in learning outcomes and curriculum content domains\\nemphasising three types of phonological awareness skills including syllable awareness,rhyme awareness, and phoneme awareness (Table 1) (Ministry of Education, 2008).\\nDialogic reading\\nDR is an interactive shared-reading technique developed in the late 1980s by White-\\nhurst and colleagues (Whitehurst et al., 1988). There are three key principles guiding\\nthe DR, including (a) encouraging the child to participate by using prompts, (b) provid-ing feedback to the child, and (c) adapting the reading style of the adult to the child\\u2019s\\nlinguistic abilities (Whitehurst et al., 1988, 1994). DR techniques are represented by1230 R.A. Elmonayer\\ntwo acronyms CROWD and PEER. CROWD refers to the \\ufb01ve types of prompts or\\nquestions asked by adults when engaging in DR with young children, including (a)Completion prompts including \\ufb01ll-in-the-blank questions, (b) Recall prompts including\\nquestions that require the child to remember aspects of the book, (c) Open-ended\\nprompts including statements that encourage the child to respond to the book in hisor her own words, (d) Wh-prompts including what, where, and why questions, and\\n(e) Distancing prompts including questions that require the child to relate the content\\nof the book to aspects of life outside of the book. PEER refers to the following: (a)Prompt the child to label the objects in the book and talk about the story, (b) Evaluate\\nthe child\\u2019s responses, (c) Expand the child\\u2019s verbalisation by repeating what the child\\nhas said and adding information to it, and (d) encourage the child to Repeat theexpanded utterances (Zevenbergen & Whitehurst, 2003). Vygotsky\\u2019s concept of\\nzone of proximal development (ZPD) helps explain why DR is such an effective tech-\\nnique; Vygotsky believed that children learn best when adults (or more skilled peers)expose them to ideas that are just a bit beyond where they are in their own development;\\ntherefore, when an adult is successful at keeping the dialogue and questioning duringTable 1.

The International Reading Association and the National Associationfor the Education of Young Children (1998) emphasised, in their joint position state-\\nment on early literacy, the value of providing children generous access to storybooks\\nand engaging them in high-quality interactive reading. The developing early literacyreport of the National Early Literacy Panel (2008) emphasised that shared-reading\\ninterventions with an interactive reading component such as DR produced larger\\neffects on children\\u2019s oral language outcomes than non-interactive interventions. Theresearch \\ufb01ndings emphasised that using DR in preschool and kindergarten classrooms\\nhas signi\\ufb01cant positive effects on several aspects of children\\u2019s language learning, such\\nas meaning construction (Gregory & Cahill, 2011), narrative skills (Lever & Se \\u00b4ne\\u00b4chal,\\n2011; Zevenbergen, Whitehurst, & Zevenbergen, 2003), oral language and print knowl-\\nedge (Mol, Bus, & de Jong, 2009), and expressive and receptive vocabulary (Hargrave\\n& Senechal, 2000; Mincic, 2009; Mol et al., 2009; Opel, Ameer, & Aboud, 2009;Udaka, 2009; Wasik & Bond, 2001).\\nDR, as an interactive shared-reading technique, can play a role in promoting phono-\\nlogical awareness skills of kindergarten children (Gill, 2006; Trehearne, 2003). Story-books are one of the most valuable DR materials for promoting phonological\\nawareness of young children. They have at least two advantages: \\ufb01rst, they will make\\nthe phonological awareness activities more meaningful and connect them more clearlyto the print. Second, they will motivate children and teachers, resulting in increased\\nlevels of practice (Allor & McCathren, 2003). The research \\ufb01ndings emphasised the posi-\\ntive effects of interactive shared-reading techniques on children\\u2019s phonological aware-ness in preschool and kindergarten classrooms, using storybooks as reading materials.\\nLefebvre, Trudeau, and Sutton (2011) examined the effect of shared storybook-\\nreading (SSR) intervention using DR strategies on phonological awareness skills(including rhyme judgement, initial consonant comparison, syllable segmentation, and\\nsyllable deletion) of low-income French-speaking preschoolers. The result showed\\nthat the experimental group outperformed the control group on phonological awarenessscores. Ziolkowski and Goldstein (2008) examined the ef\\ufb01cacy of an explicit English\\nphonological awareness intervention embedded within repeated SSR with preschool\\nchildren from low-income backgrounds with language delays. The result showed thatthe intervention improved children\\u2019s rhyme awareness (rhyme production and rhyme\\nidenti\\ufb01cation) and enhanced children\\u2019s alliteration and initial sound \\ufb02uency skills.\\nUkrainetz, Cooney, Dyer, Kysar, and Harris (2000) examined teaching English phone-mic awareness by embedding sound talk within meaningful small group literacy experi-\\nences of SSR and writing for \\ufb01ve-year-old and six-year-old children. The results showed\\nthat treatment-speci\\ufb01c improvement was evident in three phonemic awareness skills:\\ufb01rst sound identi\\ufb01cation, last sound identi\\ufb01cation, and sound segmentation.\\nAlphabet books are another valuable DR material that can help in promoting pho-\\nnological awareness of young children. Alphabet book represents the reading materialthat enables \\u2018teachers and children talk about sounds, in addition to letters, as they look\\nat and read it\\u2019 (Yopp & Yopp, 2009, p. 71). Cardoso-Martins et al. (2011) suggested\\nthat preschool children bene\\ufb01t from letter name knowledge and phonological aware-ness in learning letter\\u2013sound relations. Piasta, Purpura, and Wagner (2010) suggested\\nthat the instructional approach that combined letter name and sound instruction helps\\npromote letter sound acquisition of preschool children.1232 R.A. Elmonayer\\nTherefore, the combination of storybooks and alphabet books in alphabet storybook\\nform may represent another valuable DR material for promoting phonological aware-\\nness, by providing meaningful stories that elicit talk about letters and sounds and allow-\\ning the use of sound-focused prompts during the reading of storybooks. Presenting suchreading materials via PowerPoint may provide more prompting for phonological aware-\\nness skills. \\u2018PowerPoint has many features to facilitate the acquisition of these skills,\\nincluding the ability of the teacher to modify features such as (a) colour, (b) pictures,(c) sounds, (d) animation, (e) slide design, and (f) slide transition\\u2019 (Parette et al.,\\n2008, p. 234).\\nHypothesis\\nThe purpose of the present study was to examine the effect of DR on the promotion of\\nArabic phonological awareness skills of kindergarteners. The author hypothesised thatDR would increase phonological awareness skills of kindergarten children. As applied\\nto this study, the independent variable, DR activities, would positively in\\ufb02uence the\\ndependent variable, phonological awareness. Speci\\ufb01cally, the author expected that chil-dren who engage in DR activities would improve in their phonological awareness skills.\\nMethod\\nParticipants\\nThe participants were 67 \\ufb01ve-year-olds and six-year-olds, enrolled in the second level\\nof kindergarten (KG2), in two private elementary schools, in Ismailia city. Two KG2classrooms, one classroom in each school, represented the control and experimental\\ngroups of this study. The control group of this study included 32 children. On\\naverage, the children were 65.34 months of age (SD \\u00bc1.43), with an age range\\nfrom 64.12 to 69.15 months. The experimental group of this study included 35 children.\\nOn average, the children were 65.86 months of age (SD \\u00bc1.76), with an age range\\nfrom 64.15 to 70.22 months. The equivalence between the participants of the twogroups, in age, level of intelligence, and socioeconomic status, was veri\\ufb01ed statistically\\nusing t-test for independent samples, via SPSS (version 12.0 for Windows).\\nMeasures\\nKindergarten inventory of phonological awareness\\nThe author developed an Arabic phonological awareness inventory in the light of rel-\\nevant previous studies. It was an individually administered inventory that included 54\\npractice items classi\\ufb01ed into nine groups or items, with each group having six items.\\nGroups 1 and 2 assessed syllable awareness skills, groups 3 and 4 assessed rhymeawareness skills, and groups 5\\u20139 assessed phoneme awareness. The nine groups of\\npractice items included the following: (1) syllable-blending items; the children were\\nverbally presented with six words, each word was broken into parts, and were askedto put the parts of each word together and say the whole word; (2) syllable segmentation\\nitems; the children were verbally presented with six words and were asked to break each\\nword into parts; (3) rhyme identi\\ufb01cation/recognising items; the children were presentedwith six pairs of pictures named by the examiner and were asked to tell if any two words\\nsound alike or not; (4) rhyme production items; the children were verbally presentedEarly Child Development and Care 1233\\nwith six words and were asked to tell a word with a sound similar to that of each pre-\\nsented word (the answers may be real or nonsense words); (5) phoneme identi\\ufb01cation\\nitems; the children were verbally presented with six groups of three words and were\\nasked to tell the sound that is the same in each of the three words; (6) phoneme isolation(initial) items; the children were presented with six pictures named by the examiner and\\nwere asked to tell the sound that they heard at the beginning of each word; (7) phoneme\\nisolation (\\ufb01nal) items; in each item, the children were presented with a picture named bythe examiner and were asked to tell the sound that they heard at the end of the word; (8)\\nphoneme-blending items; in each item, the children were verbally presented with six\\nwords, each word was spoken as separate phonemes, and were asked to identify theword; and (9) phoneme-segmenting items; the children were presented with six pictures\\nnamed by the examiner and were asked to tell the sounds that they heard in each word.\\nThe children\\u2019s response to each item in the inventory was recorded as either correct (1point) or incorrect (0 point).\\nThe validity of the inventory was determined by content-related validity. In general,\\nthe content-related evidence demonstrates the degree to which the items on the inven-tory are representative of a domain. To establish the content validity for the inventory of\\nthis study, a panel of child education and Arabic language-teaching professors reviewed\\neach item to ensure the construction of an instrument that re\\ufb02ected the domains of inter-est. Suggestions for modi\\ufb01cations on some of the items were provided by the panel.\\nThese included rephrasing items. After carrying out the necessary modi\\ufb01cations, the\\npanel reported that the inventory was appropriate for this study.\\nThe inventory was piloted with a group of 20 kindergarteners, other than those\\nincluded in this study to ensure reliability. Two statistical methods were used to deter-\\nmine reliability via SPSS (version 12.0 for Windows): one was an internal consistencyapproach by calculating the value of alpha reliability co-ef\\ufb01cient. The results were a\\u00bc\\n0.719 for the inventory\\u2019s total scores. The other was a test\\u2013retest method with a three-\\nweek gap. A co-ef\\ufb01cient of the stability of the inventory was calculated using the Spear-man correlation co-ef\\ufb01cient formula. Items in the inventory had positive correlations\\nr\\u00bc0.76, indicating the reliability of the inventory.\\nLater, the inventory was administered to the children in the original study represent-\\ning the two groups, experimental and control, once at the beginning of phonological\\nawareness instruction, as pre-tests, and then re-administered at the end of the instruc-\\ntion, as post-tests.\\nProcedure\\nThe DR material used in this study was designed and developed by the author. It was an\\nArabic alphabet storybook developed via PowerPoint and included 28 picture stories,\\none story for each letter. Each alphabet story included a main event described as awhole story in three to four short sentences, with animation and sound. The stories\\nhad various vocabulary words that included the sound and letter in different word pos-\\nitions as well as rhyming words. The alphabet storybook was reviewed by the samepanel that reviewed the inventory in addition to educational technology professors.\\nDR activities were developed using DR techniques CROWD and PEER (described\\nearlier) for enhancing phonological awareness skills. The alphabet stories were distrib-uted across activities in the light of phonological awareness skills. The number of dia-\\nlogic activities reached 28 and reviewed by the same panel that reviewed the inventory.1234 R.A. Elmonayer\\nBefore implementing the original study, the experimental group teacher was trained\\nto make her get a better understanding of DR and phonological awareness. The exper-\\nimental and control group teachers were trained to administer Kindergarten Inventory\\nof Phonological Awareness .\\nThe pre-tests were administered before implementing DR activities. All the children\\nin the two groups were tested individually and the assessment was administered in a\\nquiet room at school. For the experimental group, dialogic storybook readings tookplace as a whole group activity using alphabet storybook presentation, whereas the\\nfollow-up activities consisted of smaller groups of four to \\ufb01ve children. Activities\\noccurred prior to or following the story to provide the children with background infor-mation and additional experiences. The teacher was responsible for reading the story\\nand implementing the follow-up DR activities. The control group continued with\\ntheir regular classroom activities. When the DR activities came to an end, the post-tests were administered to the participants in the two groups. Finally, all the data\\nwere gathered and analysed.\\nResults\\nThis study examined whether phonological awareness instruction, utilising DR tech-\\nniques, embedded in whole-class literacy activities, resulted in gains in three types\\nof phonological awareness skills (including syllable awareness, rhyme awareness,\\nand phoneme/phonemic awareness) compared with the control condition; statisticalanalyses were performed using independent-samples t-test, via SPSS (version 12.0\\nfor Windows). Effect sizes were hand-calculated using the eta-squared statistic\\nformula\\nh2\\u00bct2/t2+(N1+N2\\u2013 2) (Pallant, 2005); Cohen\\u2019s (1988) benchmarks for\\nh2were used to determine the effect size (0.01 is considered a small effect size, 0.06\\na medium effect size, and 0.14 a large effect size).\\nSyllable awareness performance\\nAs can be seen from Table 2, children\\u2019s mean scores in the syllable awareness pre-test\\n(including syllable-blending, syllable-segmenting, and whole syllable awareness skills)\\nwere about 11%, 7%, and 9%, respectively, in both the groups; independent-samples t-\\ntest revealed no signi\\ufb01cant differences between the two groups.

Consistent with previous research\\n(Lefebvre et al., 2011; Ukrainetz et al., 2000; Ziolkowski & Goldstein, 2008), the \\ufb01nd-\\nings of this study indicate that DR is successful in increasing phonological awarenessskills. However, the present study has certain advantages when compared with previous\\nresearch because it focuses on teaching Arabic phonological awareness through whole-\\nclass DR activities, using an alphabet storybook as a DR material presented to thewhole class via PowerPoint. With a sample of Egyptian kindergarteners, \\ufb01ve-year-\\nold and six-year-old children, the present study examined the effect of this interactive\\nshared-reading technique on the promotion of three types of phonological awarenessincluding (a) syllable awareness (including syllable blending and syllable segmenting),\\n(b) rhyme awareness (including rhyme identi\\ufb01cation and rhyme production), and (c)1236 R.A.

The author considers these positive results to be due to the speci\\ufb01c\\ndesign of the DR activities, which allowed the children to participate actively in the\\nactivities preceding, during, and after the reading session. They were provided withopportunities to ask questions related to the story content as well as the classroom\\nenvironment. Their comments, questions, and responses were expanded by the\\nteacher. Prompts assisted the children in elaborating their responses. The alphabetstorybook presentation provided meaningful texts and allowed discussing units of\\nsound in speech (syllables, rhymes, and phonemes) within conversations embedded\\nin reading. It enabled the children to learn letter\\u2013sound relations (Cardoso-Martinset al., 2011; Piasta et al., 2010), prompted their active engagement, and helped draw\\ntheir attention to each word and its sound structure as it was read. The follow-up activi-\\nties provided more training phonological awareness skills. They included variousgames that stimulated language play and prompted children\\u2019s attempts to manipulate\\nthe sounds of their language in enjoyable contexts (Yopp & Yopp, 2009). Using con-\\ncrete representations, such as chips and blocks, to represent sound units was anotherimportant prompt that assisted the children in elaborating their responses. It helped\\nease the memory load, enabled better task performance, allowed for the children to\\ndemonstrate gradual skill mastery (Phillips, Clancy-Menchetti, & Lonigan, 2008),and helped make mental manipulations of sounds easier for some children (Yopp &\\nYopp, 2009). In addition, positive peer interactions during collaborative group work\\nenabled peer\\u2013peer scaffolding (Ukrainetz et al., 2000) and allowed some children toparticipate as tutors (Udaka, 2009).\\nBased on the results of this study, the author makes some recommendations. First,\\nthe effort required to include such DR activities in kindergarten programmes should becarefully considered by those responsible. Second, Kindergarten Inventory of Phono-\\nlogical Awareness , which yielded good internal consistency and allowed for the exam-\\nination of three types of Arabic phonological awareness skills and their sub-skills, canbe used as a tool for assessing children\\u2019s progress. Third, kindergartens should be pro-\\nvided with well-developed DR materials presented via PowerPoint, which could help\\nprompt their active engagement during reading activities. Fourth, pre-service and in-service kindergarten teachers should be trained as to how DR can be used effectively\\nin classroom settings. Finally, parents should be trained to implement effective DR\\nactivities at home.\\nDespite the signi\\ufb01cant strengths of the present study, certain study limitations\\nshould be noted. First, the sample used in the present study was relatively small and\\nwas composed of children in the second level of kindergarten (ages 5\\u20136). Second,this study was implemented in a private elementary school, in one city in Egypt.\\nThird, this study was limited in its duration as it was implemented over a period of\\neight weeks at the beginning of the academic school year. Therefore, the generalisabil-ity of the \\ufb01ndings may be limited.\\nAdditional research is needed to give more implications for teaching Arabic phono-\\nlogical awareness as well as using DR in kindergarten classrooms. Future researchshould attempt to replicate the \\ufb01ndings of this study in other samples to guarantee\\nthe generalisability of the \\ufb01ndings. Research on using DR to achieve the goals of\\nArabic language teaching in the light of national standards, using larger and more1238 R.A. Elmonayer\\nheterogeneous samples of KG1 and KG2 children, is needed. Future research should\\nalso attempt to examine the effects of Arabic phonological awareness instruction on\\nthe promotion of different aspects of language learning. Studies that examine the\\neffects of DR using PowerPoint presentations on the promotion of different aspectsof language learning are needed. In addition, future research should attempt to\\nexamine the effects of DR on the promotion of Arabic phonological awareness of\\nspecial-needs kindergarteners such as autistic, educable mentally retarded, and learningdisabled children.\\nIn summary, DR activities appear to have positive effects on Arabic phonological\\nawareness of kindergarteners. Speci\\ufb01cally, whole-class DR activities positively in\\ufb02u-enced three types of Arabic phonological awareness of Egyptian kindergarteners\\n(including syllable awareness, rhyme awareness, and phoneme awareness). These \\ufb01nd-\\nings suggest that DR is an effective method for teaching phonological awareness in kin-dergarten classrooms.\\nNotes on contributors\\nRanda Abdelaleem Elmonayer, PhD, is an assistant professor of kindergarten curriculum and\\ninstruction at the Department of Curriculum and Instruction, Faculty of Education, Suez\\nCanal University, Ismailia, Egypt.\\nReferences\\nAbdel Kareem, F.

Twenty Spanish-speaking mother-child dyads were assigned to one of two conditions (shared-book reading curriculum, or control condition). Child participants were tested at three points in time on general Spanish receptive and expressive vocabulary, knowledge of targeted words taught by the shared-book reading curriculum, knowledge of concepts about print (CAP) and oral narrative abilities (microstructure and macrostructure elements). Based on prior research, it was predicted that children in the intervention group would outperform their peers in the control group on all outcome variables at post-testing and at the 12-month follow-up.   Results at post-testing revealed positive effects of the Spanish shared-book reading curriculum on measures of generalized receptive vocabulary, targeted receptive vocabulary, CAP, microstructural oral narrative skills (lengthier mean length utterances; MLU) for the story retell task and macrostructural oral narrative skills (story grammar) for the two oral narrative tasks (story retell and story spontaneous). Results at the 12-month follow-up revealed a positive impact of the intervention for the story retell task. Although we were unable to detect long-term sustained effects of the intervention on all child outcome variables, the pilot study makes a contribution to the literature by showing that teaching Low-SES Spanish-speaking parents how to use a scripted shared-book reading curriculum that incorporates cognitively complex questions about words \\n \\n iii and stories before, during and after reading, can produce positive impacts on children\\u2019s oral language, CAP and narrative skills at short-term. Implications, limitations and directions for future research are discussed.       \\n \\n iv DEDICATION   Dedico con gran orgullo y placer este trabajo a mi familia, en especial a mi madre, Griselda Vidal Vaquero.

A considerable amount of research has shown that teaching parents how to engage interactively during SBR with their young children produces positive outcomes on children\\u2019s oral language  (e.g., Mol, Bus, De Jong, & Smeets, 2008; Whitehurst et al., 1988) and emergent literacy skills (NELP; Lonigan, Shanahan & Cunningham, 2008).  The majority of these studies have focused on English-speaking families and their children (Manz, Hughes, Barnabas, Bracaliello, & Ginsburg-Block, 2010; Perry, Kay, & Brown, 2008).  Very limited research is available on parent-child native language interventions among diverse populations, especially growing populations like Spanish-speaking Latinos, despite the presumption being that building first language skills in the primary language helps in second language acquisition (Cummins, 1979). The present pilot study examined the effects of a12-week Spanish-language parent-delivered shared-book reading curriculum on an array of young Latino children\\u2019s language and emergent literacy outcome variables using a pre-, post- between group test design with a 12- month follow-up. Background Oral language and emergent literacy skills developed during the preschool years are important precursors to conventional reading and strong predictors of later reading \\n \\n 2 success. Despite its importance in the early years, not all children enter kindergarten equally prepared to benefit from formal literacy instruction, especially ethnically and socioeconomically diverse children (Hecht, Burgess, Torgesen, Wagner, & Rashotte, 2000; Lee & Burkam, 2002). Over the decades, research has shown that children from low socioeconomic backgrounds enter school with lower oral language and literacy skills when compared to children with more affluent backgrounds or with more educated parents (Brooks-Gunn & Markman, 2005; Hecht et al., 2000). Longitudinal studies have shown that in the absence of intervention, differences in verbal abilities are remarkably stable over time (Cunningham & Stanovich, 1997; Hart & Risley, 1995). For example, vocabulary skills assessed in the elementary years have been found to be a strong predictor of reading comprehension in 11th grade (Cunningham & Stanovich, 1997). In other words, evidence suggests that difficulties persist into high school and likely beyond in students with limited vocabulary skills. One particularly vulnerable group for poor academic outcomes are young Latino children. Latino children often experience multiple risk factors (e.g., poverty, limited English proficiency, poor neighborhoods, low quality teachers) that affect their ability to acquire important foundational language and literacy skills.  For example, it was estimated that in 2003 34% of Latino children under the age of 5 lived in poverty (Barrueco, L\\u00f3pez & Miles, 2007). Evidence shows that Latino children living in poverty are more likely to experience less exposure to literacy activities at home (Barrueco, L\\u00f3pez & Miles, 2007). According to a report by the Federal Interagency Forum on Child and Family Statistics (2009), in 2007, only 35% of Hispanic children ages 3-5 were read \\n \\n 3 to daily by a family member compared to 67% of White non-Hispanic children and 60% of Asian children. Furthermore, findings from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Research Study (Lee & Burkam, 2002) indicated that reading readiness scores for Latino preschool age children are half or more standard deviations below their White peers at the beginning of Kindergarten. Unfortunately, in the absence of intervention, the gaps persist throughout the kindergarten and beyond on measures of letter recognition and phonological awareness skills (West, Denton & Reaney, 2001).   Reading gaps between Latino and White students tend to persist beyond kindergarten based on a recent report published by the National Education Center of Educational Statistics (Hemphill & Vanneman, 2011) that evaluated the performance of 4th and 8th grade students nationwide on reading, mathematics and other academic every year. For 2009, fourth-grade and eighth-grade Latino students obtained an average group score significantly below that of White peers. Given that Latino children are likely to enter schooling with a disadvantage in oral language and emergent literacy skills, the evidence is clear about the urgent need for early interventions focused on the Latino population before the gaps form, especially in important environments like the home.   Studies with English monolingual students have revealed a positive relationship between the home literacy activities (e.g., parent-child shared-book reading) and children\\u2019s language and emergent literacy skills (Mol et al., 2008; Snow, Barnes, Chandler, Goodman, & Hemphill, 1991). Given the documented benefits of parent-child interactive reading and the educational needs of Latino young children, the paucity of research with this population is surprising. This was noted in a recent descriptive \\n \\n 4 analysis of studies conducted by Manz, Hughes, Barnabas, Bracaliello, and Ginsburg-Block (2010). Latino children were the least represented among the samples, as they were only included in eight studies out of thirty-one family-based intervention studies reviewed. Furthermore, there is a paucity of research examining the effects of Spanish shared-book reading interventions with Latino families. Only two studies were found that implemented a home-based parent-child SBR intervention in Spanish with Latinos; however, these studies were implemented in combination with a school or researcher-implemented intervention in English (Roberts, 2008; Tsybina & Eriks-Brophy, 2009). Although only a few, the results of these studies suggest that interactive parent-child SBR interventions have potential positive impacts on oral language skills with Latino Spanish-speaking families. These results provide initial support of potential benefits of implementing SBR interventions in children\\u2019s native language. As such, there is a need for more research with Spanish-speaking Latino families.   Current Study The present pilot study examined the effects of a Spanish-language parent-delivered 12-week SBR curriculum on participating Spanish-speaking children\\u2019s oral language skills (generalized and targeted vocabulary), knowledge of concepts about print (CAP) and oral narrative abilities (microstructural and macrostructural elements). The curriculum for this study was adapted from a multi-component vocabulary and knowledge-building curriculum delivered in the context of story read-alouds in the schools (Pollard-Durodola et al., 2011). The Spanish home-based curriculum is grounded on the interactive SBR model and organized around thematic units (science \\n \\n 5 and social studies) that support the development of vocabulary and background knowledge through the use of scripted cognitively demanding questions and prompts. The Spanish home-based curriculum had been previously implemented in combination with the school-based intervention (Pollard-Durodola et al., 2011); however, the independent contribution of the home-based intervention to language and literacy outcomes has not been investigated to date.  Providing instruction to Latino Spanish-speaking preschool-age children in their primary or native language (L1) has been widely supported in the literature as good practice. Research has demonstrated that building students\\u2019 language and literacy skills in their primary language can in turn promote their skills in their second language (L2). Cummins\\u2019 (1979; 1981) theoretical work illustrated the interdependence between L1 and L2. In his Interdependence Hypothesis he posited that instruction provided in L1 is effective in promoting proficiency in L1 and that the transfer of this proficiency to L2 will occur provided there is adequate exposure to L2 and adequate motivation to learn L2.  Given that most, if not all Spanish speaking preschool children, will be attending school where learning English is one of the primary aims, increasing their language knowledge in L1 can presumably be related to a later increase of these same skills in L2.  Using a pre-, post-between-groups with a 12-month follow-up test design, the following research questions were investigated. 1. What are the effects of a Spanish home-based shared-book reading curriculum on standardized (ROWPVT) and researcher-developed (RDRVT) measures of Spanish receptive vocabulary? \\n \\n 6 a. It is hypothesized that the children in the intervention group will obtain higher scores on the standardized and research developed receptive vocabulary tests in Spanish at post-test than children in the control group.  2. What are the effects of a Spanish home-based shared-book reading curriculum on standardized (EOWPVT) and researcher developed (RDEVT) measures of Spanish expressive vocabulary? Hypothesis a. It is hypothesized that children in the intervention group will obtain higher scores on the standardized and Researcher-Developed receptive vocabulary tests in Spanish at post-test than children in the control group.  3. What are the effects of a Spanish home-based shared-book reading curriculum on children\\u2019s knowledge of Spanish Concepts About Print (RDCAPT)? Hypothesis a. It is hypothesized that children in the intervention group will obtain higher scores on the Spanish CAP task at post-test than children in the control group.  4. What are the effects of the Spanish home-based shared-book reading curriculum on children\\u2019s Spanish-language microstructure and macrostructure oral narrative skills? Hypotheses a. It is hypothesized that children in the intervention group will obtain higher scores on Spanish-language measures of productivity and grammatical \\n \\n 7 complexity (microstructural narrative elements) at post-test than children in the control group.  b. It is hypothesized that children in the intervention group will obtain higher scores on measures of Spanish-language narrative organization, story grammar and coherence (macrostructure narrative elements) at post-test than children in the control group.  5. Assuming that the Spanish shared-book reading curriculum is effective in enhancing children\\u2019s vocabulary outcome skills (ROWPVT, RDRVT, EOWPVT, RDEVT) at post-testing, are the effects maintained at the 12-month follow-up? Hypothesis  a. It is hypothesized that children in the intervention group will obtain higher scores on measures of vocabulary (expressive and receptive) at the 12-month follow-up than children in the control group.  6. Assuming that the Spanish shared-book reading curriculum was effective in enhancing children\\u2019s Spanish CAP skills at post-testing, are the effects maintained at the 12-month follow-up? Hypothesis  b. It is hypothesized that children in the intervention group will obtain higher scores on the CAP measure at the 12-month follow-up than children in the control group.  \\n \\n 8 7. Assuming that the Spanish shared-book reading curriculum was effective in enhancing children\\u2019s microstructure and macrostructure oral narrative skills at post-testing, are the effect maintained at the 12-month follow-up? Hypothesis  c. It is hypothesized that children in the intervention group will obtain higher scores on measure of microstructure and macrostructure narrative elements at the 12-month follow-up testing than children in the control group.  It is hypothesized that a statistically significant difference will be detected between groups on all child measures (vocabulary, CAP and oral narrative skills) at post-testing and at the 12-month follow-up. Past research has demonstrated that home-delivered SBR interventions can enhance children\\u2019s oral language and literacy skills (Mol et al., 2008; Whitehurst, et al., 1988). These findings provide the foundation for the hypotheses for research questions 1 through 4. Specifically, findings from Roberts (2008) and Tsybina and Eriks-Brophy (2009) suggested that interactive SBR interventions in Spanish can be effective in increasing Spanish-speaking children\\u2019s vocabulary skills.     \\n \\n 9 CHAPTER II LITERATURE REVIEW  Reading books to children is one of the most popular and enduring method adults use to support young children\\u2019s language and literacy development (Bus, van IJzendoorn, & Pelligrini, 1995; Dickinson 2001; Scarborough & Dobrich, 1994). Sometimes referred to as interactive reading, shared reading, joint book reading, reading aloud, or dialogic reading, the process of adults reading to children and interacting with books provides a context for developing a range of skills in young children (McKeown & Beck, 2006). With over two decades of research as evidence, the benefits of adults reading to children on language and literacy development is no longer disputed. Promise notwithstanding, evidence also suggests that the absence of adult-child interactive activities such as shared reading in the home and other environments has significant negative effects on language development and later reading achievement of many children, especially those from economically disadvantaged or diverse backgrounds (Payne, Whitehurst & Angell, 1994). Because the family provides the earliest learning environment for a child, more research is needed on how family literacy experiences contribute to the development of early reading skills, especially among low socioeconomic and diverse families and their children before early disparities begin.   Many studies document that parents engaging interactively in SBR with their preschool age children contributes to positive effects on children\\u2019s oral language (e.g., Mol et. al., 2008) and emergent literacy skills (Lonigan, Shanahan & Cunningham, \\n \\n 10 2008). However, the majority of these studies have focused almost exclusively on Caucasian parents and their children (Manz et al., 2010; Perry, Kay & Brown, 2008). There is a relative paucity of research focused on Spanish-speaking Latino children and their families (Lonigan, Schatschneider, & Westberg, 2008) who are now the fastest growing group of students in the United States (Humes, Jones & Ramirez, 2011). To understand the relevance of a paucity of research, it is first important to understand the context for the concerns.  Latino children are an educationally vulnerable group of students due to exposure to at least one, if not more risk factors associated with academic difficulties (Hern\\u00e1ndez, Denton, & Macartney, 2007). These include, but are not limited to living in poverty, having a parent(s) with low literacy levels, having less access to health care and having limited English proficiency. It was estimated that in 2003, 34% of Latino children under 5-years of age live in poverty in the United States (Barrueco, Lopez & Miles, 2007). In the presence of economic hardship, Latino children frequently have less access to resources important in the development of language and literacy skills in the home (Barrueco et al., 2007; Raikes et al., 2006). These children are likely to enter kindergarten with lower levels of school readiness in comparison to White and Black children (Duncan & Magnuson, 2005; Lee & Burkam, 2002). Findings from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Research Study (Lee & Burkam, 2002) confirmed that reading readiness scores for Latino children are indeed about half a standard deviation or more below their White peers at the beginning of Kindergarten. \\n \\n 11 Reading gaps between Latinos and Whites, in particular, have remained relatively stable as indicated by a recent published report by the National Education Center of Educational Statistics (Hemphill & Vanneman, 2011) comparing student performance in mathematics and reading from 1992 to 2009. For 1992, fourth and eighth grade Latino students as a group scored 23 and 27 points respectively below their White peers. For 2009, Latino students continued the trend of obtaining a group reading average score well below that of their White peers. Given the early and remarkably persistent gaps between Latino and Caucasian children, the National Early Literacy Panel (NELP, 2009) concluded that more research is needed targeting minority-language students. It is these concerns expressed by national experts, review panels and published reports on the reading achievement gaps of Latino students that provide a context for the present study.  In the present review of the literature, the following is outlined: a) an overview of the development of oral language and emergent literacy skills, with a focus on the role of vocabulary, oral narrative development and knowledge of concepts about print; b) the home literacy environment as a context for intervention; and c) parent-delivered SBR as a strategic and intentional instructional activity to foster language and literacy in young children. Developing Children\\u2019s Oral Language and Literacy Skills At its simplest, literacy refers to the ability to read and write. For effective reading, decoding and language comprehension (written and spoken) skills are necessary. These skills develop over time and begin developing before formal \\n \\n 12 instruction occurs. During the preschool years children develop language skills that largely influence their long-term ability to read with comprehension. From age three, trends in children\\u2019s familiarity with unusual words, amount of talk, and vocabulary levels are well established and indicative of widening gaps to come (Hart & Risley, 1995). Children who lag behind in reading development read less than other children, miss opportunities to develop reading comprehension strategies, often encounter reading material that is too difficult for their skill level, and develop negative attitudes towards reading (Lonigan & Whitehurst, 1998).  While very young children cannot read in the conventional sense, they do display reading-related precursor skills typically referred to as \\u201cemergent literacy\\u201d skills. Emergent literacy refers to the skills, knowledge, and attitudes that are presumed to be developmental precursors to conventional forms of reading and writing (Sulzby & Teale, 1991; Whitehurst & Lonigan, 1998). Emergent literacy skills identified as being foundational skills include oral language (e.g., vocabulary, narrative skills), knowledge of concepts about print, emergent writing skills, alphabet knowledge and phonological awareness (Whitehurst & Lonigan, 1998). According to Whitehurst and Lonigan\\u2019s emergent literacy model, these skills develop along a continuum rather than in an \\u201call-or-none\\u201d phenomenon and can be acquired concurrently and interdependently early in a child\\u2019s life. Of importance, Whitehurst and Lonigan emphasized that these skills develop from exposure to interactions in the social context (e.g., adult-child interactions in the home or school). Evidence for the prominence of emergent literacy skills in the development of skilled reading also stems from large-scale and rigorous quantitative \\n \\n 13 reviews of the literature. The National Early Literacy Panel (NELP; Strickland & Shanahan, 2004) convened in 2002 to review the literature on early literacy practices, processes and evidence. The results of one of their meta-analysis conducted by Lonigan, Schatschneider, and Westberg (2008) identified 11 skills that predicted reading and writing skills. Alphabet knowledge, phonological awareness (awareness of spoken sounds), rapid automatic naming of letters or digits, rapid automatic naming of colors, emergent writing and phonological memory were identified as strong predictors of later literacy. Concepts about print (knowledge about print conventions and books), print knowledge (include a combination of alphabet knowledge, concepts about print & early decoding), reading readiness (combination of alphabet knowledge, print awareness and vocabulary), oral language skills (receptive and expressive vocabulary, grammar) and visual processing were identified as moderate predictors of later literacy. NELP\\u2019s results provided researchers, educators, and policy makers with a better understanding of which emergent literacy skills are central to the development of reading skills in young children; however, it is also important to note that the findings were drawn from data that almost exclusively examined the literacy skills of English monolinguals. The authors noted that it was impossible to evaluate research questions pertaining to English Language Learners (who are predominantly Spanish-speaking) because of the limited data available, and they emphasized the need for more research with this population.  The research in emergent literacy skills clearly suggests that young children need to be taught and to learn a series of important precursor skills prior to learning conventional reading. Therefore, instruction and interventions centered on teaching these \\n \\n 14 skills are important, especially for diverse children (e.g., Spanish-speaking) who may grow up with limited exposure to experiences that promote these skills. More relevant to the proposed study, the following sections present a discussion of the role of vocabulary, oral narrative skills, and knowledge of concepts of print in the preschool years in relation to the development of literacy and later reading.   Vocabulary Development Vocabulary has long been recognized as an important component of reading. Vocabulary refers to knowledge of words and word meaning. Broadly, word knowledge can be broken into two categories, receptive and expressive vocabulary. Receptive vocabulary refers to an understanding of words and phrases presented orally or in print, and expressive vocabulary refers to knowledge of word meaning demonstrated by the ability to use a word in speech or in print (Snow et al., 1998). Together, receptive and expressive vocabulary knowledge contributes to the depth of knowledge of word meaning. In their extensive review of the literature, the National Reading Panel (NICHD, 2000) identified vocabulary knowledge as an important component of reading.  More specifically, vocabulary in the preschool years has been found to contribute to the development of important emergent literacy skills (Leseman & de Jong, 1998), particularly to phonological awareness skills (e.g., Cooper, Roth, Speece, & Schatschneider, 2002; Metsala, 1999). In addition, a persistent research finding is the relationship between children\\u2019s vocabulary knowledge and reading comprehension. Research studies done with English monolingual preschoolers and kindergarteners indicated that vocabulary size is a strong predictor of reading comprehension skills in the \\n \\n 15 elementary years (e.g., Biemiller, 2005; Roth, Speece, & Cooper, 2002; S\\u00e9n\\u00e9chal & LeFevre, 2002). In these studies, children with large vocabularies perform better on reading comprehension measures than children with limited vocabularies. For example, in S\\u00e9n\\u00e9chal and LeFevre\\u2019s (2002) study, results indicated that receptive vocabulary assessed in kindergarten was a strong predictor of reading comprehension in third grade. The findings of other research studies indicated that vocabulary knowledge in the early school years accounts for significant variance in reading comprehension in secondary years (e.g., Cunningham & Stanovich, 1997). These findings highlight the significant role that vocabulary has on reading comprehension. A solid foundation in vocabulary in the early years set the stage for later academic success.  The development of vocabulary begins in infancy and continues into the adult years. It is estimated that young children acquire approximately 860 root word meanings per year or 2.4 root words per day, starting at age 1 through grade 2 (Biemiller, 2005).  Children acquire vocabulary primarily through incidental encounters with words in conversations (e.g., often with caregivers), print, and also through explicit instruction. For young children (non-readers), the primary source for vocabulary comes from the language input they receive (Hoff, 2003). Variations in children\\u2019s early language input have been linked to socioeconomic status (Hart & Risley 1995; Hoff, 2003). In their seminal longitudinal study, Hart and Risley (1995; 1999) documented significant differences in English-speaking children\\u2019s early family experiences and their later language ability. The researchers followed 42 families from various socio-economic backgrounds on a daily basis for two years and analyzed over 1,200 hours of audio \\n \\n 16 recordings and field notes.  Findings from their study revealed that the amount and quality (e.g. diversity in vocabulary) of parent-child conversations accounted significantly for variance in children\\u2019s vocabulary development and related strongly to intellectual outcomes at ages 3 and 9 years old. For example, children in welfare families heard approximately 616 words per hour, whereas children from professional parents heard 2,153 hours per hour- a staggering difference of 30 million words at the end of the study. Subsequent studies have also documented differences in children\\u2019s vocabulary related to differences in socio-economic status (SES). More specifically, these differences have been linked to the quality of language-learning experiences children receive (Hoff, 2003; Hoff, Laursen, & Tardif, 2002). Hoff (2003) explained that one source of SES-related difference in children\\u2019s vocabulary is related to differences in the quality of maternal speech children are exposed to. It is important to note that the majority of the studies discussed have focused on monolingual English speaking children. Although there are fewer studies focused on the Spanish-speaking Latino population, the studies that are available parallel the language effects found among monolingual English-speaking children. For example, Lindsey, Manis, and Bailey's (2003) cross-linguistic longitudinal study revealed that Spanish vocabulary assessed in kindergarten was a strong predictor of reading comprehension skills in English in first grade. Similar findings were found with a sample of 4th grade Spanish-English bilinguals; results indicated that vocabulary knowledge in Spanish contributed to reading skills in English (Proctor, Carlo, August & Snow, 2005). In Hammer, Lawrence, and Miccio\\u2019s (2007) longitudinal study, results indicated that \\n \\n 17 receptive vocabulary skills in English and Spanish acquired through a 2-year preschool program (Head Start) were a significant predictor of children\\u2019s emergent literacy skills in Kindergarten. These findings indicate that children\\u2019s language gains in the preschool years can affect their language development trajectories.  In summary, the body of research discussed demonstrate the importance of vocabulary in the development of literacy skills and documents differences in vocabulary grown in relation to: a) socio-economic status, b) diverse backgrounds, and c) the quality of the home literacy environment (HLE), particularly parent-child verbal interactions.  From these studies it can be inferred that children from low socio-economic and/or diverse backgrounds, in the absence of intervention, are likely at a higher risk for early and persistent reading difficulties.  Oral Narrative Development Similar to vocabulary development, oral narrative ability has been found to relate to literacy development (Cain, 2003; Griffin, Hemphill, Camp & Wolf, 2004; Miller et.al. 2006; Uccelli & P\\u00e1ez, 2007Snow & Dickinson, 1991; Speece, Roth, Cooper & de la Paz, 1999). Oral narrative skills assessed in the early years have been found to predict reading and writing skills in the later years (e.g., Griffin, Hemphill, Camp & Wolf, 2004; Paul & Smith, 1993) and associated with reading comprehension (Cain, 2003). For example, the results of the Griffin et al. (2004) study revealed that oral narrative ability measured in the preschool/Kindergarten years was a strong predictor of reading comprehension and writing skills at age eight. In another study with older children, \\n \\n 18 results indicated that children with poor reading comprehension skills produced oral narratives with fewer integrated event structures and connectives (Cain, 2003).  Similar findings have been found with Spanish-speaking English language learners (ELLs). In Miller et al.\\u2019s (2006) study, the productive language skills of 1,531 Latino ELLs were evaluated using narrative elicitation tasks in English and at six different time points (from Kindergarten to third grade) to determine the predictability of different narrative conditions (English or Spanish) on reading skills in English and Spanish. Results indicated that children\\u2019s productive language as measure in their oral narrative in Spanish predicted reading skills in English and English productive language predicted reading skills in Spanish. This finding suggests that assessing children\\u2019s narrative skills in English and Spanish can provide information about their linguistics skills in both language and these skills predict reading skills.  In general terms, oral narrative is a verbal account or retell of an experience (e.g., personal anecdotes, fictional stories). For a child to be able to produce an oral narrative, he/she needs to be able to incorporate several domains of language (vocabulary knowledge, syntactic and morphological knowledge) to create a cohesive story that connects information (Paul et al., 1993) for a listener who does not have prior knowledge on the topic. Thus, a narrative task requires a child to use complex sentence structures and explicit details to explain a story or decontextualized information, skills that develop gradually (McCabe & Bliss, 2003).  Liles (1993) noted that children as young as two-years old can report past personal experiences, but they are not able to produce complex personal narratives until \\n \\n 19 they are five years old. McCabe (1997) observed 5 stages of narrative development in his work of research, beginning with Labeling, which is characterized by labeling and repetition of syntax, typically produced by two-year-olds. The second stage is Listing, characterized by children listing events but no yet using temporal or causal relationship between the events. The third stage is Connecting, characterized by stories with a topic and characters actions that are linked; however, at this level, children have not yet mastered temporal sequencing. The fourth stage is Sequencing, characterized by more advanced language in the narrative, use of connections and sequencing of events. The last stage is Narrating, which includes all the stages described above and more complete narratives to which the listener can follow along without prior knowledge on the topic. McCabe observed that four-year-olds began to sequence their narratives and by age five, events were sequenced but often the narrative ended abruptly, with no conclusion or resolution to the story. By age six, children were able to produce coherent narratives. Examining children\\u2019s narrative abilities provides a source for understanding their linguistic competencies, also referred to as microstructure elements and story organization skills, also referred as macrostructure elements. Microstructure refers to the linguistic elements used by the child, with a particular focus at the utterance level (Liles, 1985). Generally, in a microstructural analysis, children\\u2019s language productivity (total number of words used), grammatical complexity and the diversity in vocabulary (total number of different words used in the narrative) is examined (Miller & Klee, 1995). Mean length of utterance (MLU) is the most popular technique employed by researchers and clinicians interested in examining children\\u2019s linguistic production abilities. The \\n \\n 20 MLU is obtained by averaging the number of words used in separate utterances (Miller, 1981). Macrostructure refers to the organization of the narrative and the use of story grammar (McCabe, 1997; Peterson & McCabe, 1991). One method for analyzing the macrostructure of oral narratives is by examining the use of story grammar, which refers to the use of setting, characters, conflict or complication and a resolution or conclusion in children\\u2019s narrative.  Consistent with other language skills, oral narrative skills are acquired through adult-child interactions (Griffin, Hemphill, Camp, and Wolf, 2004) and it is presumed that these skills can be enhanced through parent-child interactions during SBR and through exposure to reading materials (Lever & S\\u00e9n\\u00e9chal, 2011; Peterson & McCabe, 1994). The assumption is that the discussion that occur during SBR can help children practice sequencing events together and that storybook reading introduces children to story elements and story styles (e.g., Teale & Sulzby, 1999). Currently, there is limited research available examining the impact of interactive SBR on children\\u2019s oral narrative skills and the available studies have revealed mixed findings. For example, the findings of S\\u00e9n\\u00e9chal, Pagan, Lever and Ouellette\\u2019s (2008) study did not reveal a relationship between SBR and children\\u2019s oral narrative skills. The researchers investigated the relationship between frequency of SBR as reported by parent participants and children\\u2019s oral narrative skills (coherence, cohesiveness, and complexity) with a sample of 106 4-year-old English-speaking children from Canada. Results did not indicate an association between frequency of SBR and oral narrative skills. This finding was recently contradicted in a more recent study from two members of the same research team. Lever \\n \\n 21 and S\\u00e9n\\u00e9chal (2011) examined the impact of an 8-week researcher-implemented Dialogic Reading (DR) intervention on Canadian Kindergartener\\u2019s oral narrative skills. In this study, children who received the DR intervention obtained statistically significant higher scores on macrostructure elements (e.g. story grammar, mental state) when asked to retell a story than their peers in the control group who received an alternative treatment (e.g. phoneme awareness program). No group differences were found on any of the microstructure oral narrative elements (e.g. MLU, number of words and ratio of number of different words). Other studies examining the effectiveness of parent-delivered SBR intervention on various outcome variables, including oral narrative skills, have demonstrated a positive impact of the intervention on narrative skills at post-testing (Snow & Dickinson, 1990; Zevenbergen, Whitehurst, and Zevenebergen, 2003). Indisputably, more research needs to be conducted to determine if SBR interventions can indeed support the development of oral narrative skills using pre-post and longitudinal designs.  From this review of the literature, oral narrative appears to be an important skill that contributes to later academic skills. More research is needed to understand if SBR interventions can be use to foster young children\\u2019s oral narrative skills. Following is a discussion about knowledge of concepts about print and its role in literacy development.    Development of Concepts about Print (CAP) Skills related to children\\u2019s understanding of the purpose and conventions of print are commonly referred to as concepts about print (CAP; Clay, 1979), print knowledge (Justice & Ezell, 2001) or print awareness. According to Clay (1979), concepts about \\n \\n 22 print include the following skills: a) understanding that written language conveys meaning; b) understanding of how books are organized (e.g., cover, title, and author); c) understanding of reading directionality (in English-left to right and top to bottom); and d) understanding that written language consists of letters, words and sentences. Clay\\u2019s (1979) early work suggested that children experiencing reading difficulties in kindergarten often failed to pay attention to print. In other words, these children failed to pay attention to words in the books and instead focused exclusively on the illustrations.  CAP and print knowledge have been identified by NELP (2009) as important precursors to reading. Previous research has shown that print knowledge accounts for variance in a latent variable that examined alphabet skills (Storch & Whitehurst, 2002), and several other well designed studies suggested that print knowledge is a strong predictor of later reading skills (e.g., Hammill, 2004; Scarborough, 1998). The findings from these studies suggested that children who enter school with well-developed knowledge about print benefit the most from conventional instruction. Exposure to books and environmental print (e.g., street signs, posters, advertisement signs) provide preschool age children with an introduction to the nature of written language. Once children have awareness that written language is informative, that it relates to spoken language and that it has unique features, they have an easier time acquiring reading skills.  Research studies with Latino preschool age children also indicate that CAP skills can be develop in the home. Using observational research techniques, Romero (1983) and Reyes and Azuara (2008) explored preschool children\\u2019s acquisition of concepts \\n \\n 23 about print in relation to their home environment. The results of these studies suggested that these concepts are initially learned in the home-environment. Children in their studies demonstrated awareness of environmental print and had an understanding of how to manipulate a book, reading directionality, and structure of stories (e.g., beginning and end). Moreover, those children that were being raised in a Spanish-English bilingual home, versus a monolingual household, obtained higher scores on measured outcomes. This finding suggested that bilingual children demonstrate an understanding that English and Spanish are written in distinct ways thereby demonstrating metalinguistic skills (Reyes & Azuara, 2008). The results of parent-delivered SBR interventions (e.g. dialogic reading) have demonstrated a positive impact of this intervention on CAP skills (Arnold et al., 1994; Chow & McBride-Chang, 2003). The work of Justice and Ezell (2002) has also demonstrated that adult-delivered SBR interventions focused on print strategies (e.g. pointing out print, discussing print) are effective for developing children\\u2019s knowledge about words in print, print recognition, and alphabet knowledge.  In summary, language and literacy skills acquired early in a child\\u2019s life largely determine ease of entry to formal reading. Some of these language and literacy skills include vocabulary, oral narrative skills and concepts about print. The research is clear in that competence in these skills prior to kindergarten, can greatly impact children\\u2019s academic success. Unfortunately, for many children, especially children from low socio-economic and diverse backgrounds, the support for the development of these skills is often minimal or absent in the home environment. Therefore, increasing parents\\u2019 \\n \\n 24 awareness of the importance of the home literacy is critical. Following is a discussion on the role of the home literacy environment in the development of language and literacy skills.  Literacy Development and the Home Literacy Environment  According to Vygotsky\\u2019s (1978) sociocultural learning theory, development occurs within a social context. Following this logic, it suggests that children\\u2019s acquisition of language and emergent literacy skills depend largely on a strong linguistic and social support in various contexts. During the early years, the home environment is the most influential factor in a child\\u2019s language and literacy development. It is within the child\\u2019s immediate environment that oral language and emergent literacy skills are supported through adult-child interactions and literacy activities. Studies examining the everyday activities that take place in the homes of English-speaking families from various socio-economic backgrounds indicate that variations in literacy-related behaviors exists and that these variations have lasting effects on children\\u2019s development of language and literacy (e.g., Payne et al., 1994; Whitehurst & Lonigan, 1998). Much of this research suggests that children develop oral language skills when adults in their immediate environments converse with them, when they have access to reading materials and books at home, and when adults value literacy activities (e.g., Burgess, Hecht & Lonigan, 2002; Payne et al. 1994; Whitehurst & Lonigan, 1998). Findings from longitudinal studies suggest that the home literacy environment (HLE), by its direct contribution to important language and emergent literacy skills in the early years, indirectly affects the development of later literacy skills (S\\u00e9n\\u00e9chal, 2006; S\\u00e9n\\u00e9chal & \\n \\n 25 LeFevre, 2002; Whitehurst and Lonigan, 1998). For example, the results of S\\u00e9n\\u00e9chal and LeFevre\\u2019s longitudinal study indicated that SBR practices at home related to children\\u2019s receptive vocabulary development and other formal literacy activities (e.g. writing) related to children\\u2019s acquisition of important emergent literacy skills. Consistent with the research findings of studies conducted with English monolinguals, the results of a longitudinal study examining the relationship between HLE factors and bilingual children\\u2019s Spanish literacy and subsequent English reading achievement indicated that home-literacy environments as well as socio-economic status are strong predictors of children\\u2019s literacy skills in Spanish and later, in English reading skills (Reese, Garnier, Gallimore & Goldenberg, 2000).  In addition to parent literacy practices, socio-demographic characteristics and parent beliefs and attitudes have been found to be important components of the HLE and be important contributors to children\\u2019s development of oral language and emergent literacy skills (Gonzalez, Rivera, Davis & Taylor, 2010; Weigel et al., 2006). Gonzalez et al. (2010) tested a modified HLE model to explain the relationship between HLE and parental reading beliefs as predictors of preschool-age children\\u2019s receptive and expressive vocabulary. The results of their study revealed that parental (mostly maternal) reading beliefs mediated the relationship between demographic variables through the home literacy environment to positively impact vocabulary measures. Put differently, the results indicated that parents with higher levels of education had more positive HLEs; more positive HLEs, in turn, related to more facilitative reading beliefs; and facilitative reading beliefs were related to higher child receptive vocabulary. These relationships \\n \\n 26 provide evidence of the relevance of the HLE to language acquisition. As this model suggests and the research reviewed implies, the HLE is composed of numerous factors that are presumed to be important contributors to variations seen in children\\u2019s reading readiness. Notably, literacy activities in the home, especially parent-child conversational interactions, have the capacity to stimulate a variety of oral and other language and literacy skills (Leseman & de John, 2001). From among the parent-child interactions associated with acquisition of emergent literacy, exposure to shared story book reading has been well documented in its superordinate status role in facilitating acquisition of language and literacy (S\\u00e9n\\u00e9chal & LeFevre, 2002).  Shared-Book Reading  Parent-child shared book reading experiences provide an important source of vocabulary acquisition for preschool children (Cunningham, 2005; Mol et al., 2008). During SBR, preschool age children learn words that are embedded in the context of the stories (S\\u00e9n\\u00e9chal & Cornell, 1993), particularly when adults engage in evocative and elaborative conversations about the words (Penno et al., 2002; S\\u00e9n\\u00e9chal, 1997).  This type of parent-child literacy activity has been particularly beneficial for children with underdeveloped vocabularies (e.g., Mol, Bus, De Jong, & Smeets, 2008; Whitehurst & Lonigan, 1998). A specific SBR method found to be beneficial is interactive SBR. Interactive SBR is a general practice involving an adult reading and discussing a book with a child or a small group of children using different evocative language techniques. Reports from the U.S. Department of Education\\u2019s (USDOE\\u2019s) What Works Clearinghouse (WWC, 2006) and NELP (2009), indicated that as an intervention, \\n \\n 27 interactive SBR shows potential as a tool for improving children\\u2019s oral language and literacy skills. Although variations exist in the methods used, instruction generally involves engaging the child in evocative conversations about books before, during, and after reading activities (Lonigan, Shanahan, & Cunningham, 2008; Wasik & Bond, 2001).  Large-scale reviews of the literature have provided support for the use of interactive SBR as an intervention with English-speaking children (Bus et al., 1995; Lonigan et al., 2008; Scarborough & Dobrich, 1994). For example, the National Early Literacy panel reviewed the effects of 19 SBR interventions implemented by teachers, parents or a combination of both (NELP, 2009). Consistent with previous meta-analyses (Bus et. al., 1995; Scarborough & Dobrich, 1994), the results showed moderate-sized effects of the interventions on children\\u2019s oral language skills (d = .57). Additionally, the intervention was found to positively contribute to the development of print knowledge (d =.50) and writing skills (d = .52).  Similar findings were found in Mol et al.\\u2019s (2008) meta-analysis that exclusively reviewed home-based SBR interventions. The results of their meta-analysis that included studies published between 1988 to March of 2007, indicated that SBR accounted for 4% of the variance in vocabulary growth. The effect size was stronger (d = .29) when the analysis was restricted to studies that assessed expressive vocabulary. Their findings also indicated that younger children (2-to-3-year-old age group) benefitted the most from the SBR intervention.  When the researchers compared the benefits of SBR for children identified as \\u201cat risk,\\u201d for poor reading performance (based on income and parent\\u2019s reported level of education) and children not \\n \\n 28 at risk (higher SES, higher parents level of education), results revealed a smaller variance-accounted effect size for the at-risk group (1%) in comparison to children not at-risk (7%), suggesting that more intensive interventions may be needed for children at-risk for language and literacy difficulties.  A limitation of this meta-analysis was however, that demographic information of the participants was not reported (e.g., ethnic and language information); thus, to conclude that interactive SBR, as a home-based intervention is effective for all families, including Spanish-speaking Latinos, would be misleading.   Despite the positive, albeit modest effects of shared reading with young children, there remains a scarcity of studies examining the effectiveness of interactive SBR interventions with Spanish-speaking Latino young children and their families. This was noted in a recent descriptive analysis of studies conducted by Manz et al. (2010). The investigators examined 31family-based studies in their descriptive literature review and included 14 studies in their meta-analysis to determine to what extent findings from these studies were applicable to preschool children and families of ethnic minority and low-income background. They noted that almost half of the studies reviewed did not report ethnic or language information about the participants. They also noted that Latino children were the least represented among the samples, as they were only included in eight studies. Given the documented benefits of SBR on language and literacy, the relative paucity of studies with diverse populations is surprising; especially since the United States census data shows the impending demographic dominance of the Latino population. This is a major limitation in the existing literature.   \\n \\n 29 Despite the scarcity of studies, two studies were identified that implemented a parent-child SBR intervention in Spanish in combination with a researcher-implemented intervention in English to enhance the vocabulary skills of children learning a second language (Roberts, 2008; Tsybina & Eriks-Brophy, 2009) and one study that included a large sample of Spanish-speaking Latinos as part of a community-based literacy intervention designed for English speakers (Cronan, Cruz, Arriaga & Sarkin, 1996). The results of these studies provide initial evidence that interactive parent-child SBR interventions are effective with Latino Spanish-speaking families to foster oral language development of preschool children; however, more studies are needed that replicate findings with larger samples of Latinos. In Tsybina and Eriks-Brophy\\u2019s (2009) study, the authors examined the effects of dialogic book-reading intervention with 12 Spanish-English bilingual preschool age children with expressive vocabulary delays residing in Canada. Dialogic reading (DR) is one form of interactive book reading developed by Whitehurst and colleagues (1988). This method of SBR includes three techniques: (1) the use of evocative techniques to encourage children to take an active role in storytelling, (2) use of feedback in the form of expansions, corrective modeling and praise and (3) progressive change in techniques that are sensitive to a child\\u2019s development abilities (Arnold & Whitehurst, 1994; Whitehurst et. al., 1988). Children in the intervention group (N=6) received thirty 15-minute sessions of DR over a period of 6 weeks; the primary investigator provided the intervention in English and the child\\u2019s mother provided the intervention in Spanish. The combined intervention was tailored to the child\\u2019s vocabulary needs and specific words for each child were introduced during \\n \\n 30 SBR sessions. The results showed positive effects for the bilingual DR intervention; children in the intervention group learned on average 6.7 target words in English (with a range of 5 to 9) and an average of 3.2 (range from 0 to 6) words in Spanish from their individualized 20 target words (6 verbs and 14 nouns). Children in the control group learned an average of 0.8 target words in English and an average of 0.5 target words in Spanish.  Interestingly, the effects of the intervention on vocabulary growth of children were examined, as measured by a parent rating vocabulary inventory, results were not significant (Tsybina & Eriks-Brophy, 2009).  In Roberts\\u2019 (2008) study, 33 preschool children and their families from low-socioeconomic backgrounds whose primary languages were Hmong (n= 20) and Spanish (n= 13), were randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups (initial L1 home-story book or initial L2 home-story condition) to examine the relationship of story-book reading in the primary language (L1) to vocabulary acquisition in the second language (L2), English.  Midway through a 12-week intervention, families were asked to switch the language of the home SBR intervention; families in the initial L1 (Hmong or Spanish) home storybook condition switched to books in L2 (English) for weeks 7 to 12 and vice versa for the families in the other treatment condition. All parents were trained on using dialogic reading techniques, and regardless of the condition, all children received classroom-based vocabulary intervention in English.  The purpose of this study was to examine the combined effects of the home-based SBR intervention and classroom-based vocabulary instruction on children\\u2019s acquisition of vocabulary in their second language (L2). Children were pre and post-tested on standardized measures of \\n \\n 31 expressive and receptive vocabulary and on their knowledge of 36 selected words. The results indicated that providing SBR interventions in a students\\u2019 primary language did not compromise learning in the second language.  Robert reported that with the exception of 5 participants, the majority of the children made vocabulary gains (range from 2 to 9 words). A limitation of this study was the absence of a control group and information about parent\\u2019s adherence to the intervention.   The results of a community-based intervention with a sample of low-income families that include Latinos families (N=67) showed that preschool children in the study benefited the most from an intensified SBR intervention (Cronan et al., 1996).  In this study, parent-child dyads were assigned to one of three groups (high intervention (N=83), low intervention (N=73) or control group (N=69). Participants in the high intervention group received 18 instructional sessions on how to use dialogic reading techniques and techniques for teaching concepts (e.g., colors, shapes) and participants in the low-intervention group received 3 instructional sessions. Results showed positive effects for the high intervention group; children in this intervention showed greater gains in language and conceptual knowledge in comparison to children in the control group. Interestingly, fewer differences between the low-intervention group and control group were found, suggesting that low-income families benefit from high-intensity interventions.  Providing SBR interventions in a child\\u2019s primary or native language (L1) has been found to be beneficial in enhancing children\\u2019s vocabulary skills (Roberts, 2008; Tsybina & Eriks-Brophy, 2009) and it is also supported by Cummins (1979; 1981) \\n \\n 32 theoretical work on second language acquisition. Cummins (1979, 2002) postulated that the acquisition of language and academic skills in the primary language (L1) and second language (L2) is developmentally interdependent. Development of language and literacy skills in the first language can influence and facilitate development of these skills in the second language. This notion has been supported by cross-linguistic studies that have revealed that numerous oral language (e.g. phonemic awareness, vocabulary) and literacy skills (e.g. decoding) in L1 transfer to L2, particularly when the two languages share features (e.g. Lindsey, Manis, & Bailey, 2003; Nakamoto, Lindsey & Manis, 2008; Proctor et al., 2006; Snow et al., 1998). This is the case for English and Spanish; both languages use the alphabet, share numerous Latin root words and have a large number of cognates. There is evidence for a strong relationship between Spanish (L1) and English (L2) vocabulary skills (e.g., Mumtaz & Humphreys, 2002; Ord\\u00f3\\u00f1ez, Carlo, Snow & McLaughlin, 2002; Proctor, et al., 2006). For example, in Ord\\u00f3\\u00f1ez, Carlo, Snow & McLaughlin\\u2019s (2002) study, higher order vocabulary skills in Spanish were a significant predictor of English higher order vocabulary skills. These findings highlight the benefits of developing young Latino\\u2019s children\\u2018s oral language skills in their primary language. Providing Spanish-speaking parents with the tools necessary to enhance their children\\u2019s oral language and emergent literacy skills in L1 may directly facilitate the transfer of oral language skills to L2. Summary Researchers have identified important emergent literacy and oral language skills that facilitate the development of literacy and later reading with comprehension. It is \\n \\n 33 now well established that vocabulary, oral narrative, and concepts about print are important skills for conventional forms of reading. Despite this awareness, large numbers of young children, especially Latino children from lower-socio-economic background and other diverse children, fail to develop strong foundational skills needed for successful reading with fluency and comprehension. The home literacy environment in general and parent-child SBR experiences specifically, may provide opportunities to stimulate oral language growth in Latino children who are at high risk prior to formal schooling. In spite of the potential, very few studies have investigated the effects of home-based shared reading interventions in the primary language of the child as a means of fostering language and literacy development. Given the evidence for cross-linguistic transfer, developing a child\\u2019s oral language skills and concepts of print through interactive SBR in their first language may greatly facilitate the development of these same skills in English.  Study and Hypotheses The purpose of this study is to address the gap in research on parent-child SBR interventions for Spanish-speaking Latino children and their families. This exploratory study will examine the effects of a 12-week parent-delivered Spanish SBR curriculum on preschoolers\\u2019 oral language skills (vocabulary and oral narrative skills) and knowledge of concepts about print. There are two distinctive characteristics of the proposed study: a) a focus on Spanish-speaking Latino parents from low-SES background and b) the use of a SBR vocabulary-building home-based curriculum. The home-based Spanish SBR curriculum is part of a multi-component vocabulary and \\n \\n 34 knowledge-building curriculum delivered in the context of story read-alouds in the schools and in the homes (Durodola et al., 2011). The home-based curriculum was designed to facilitate the development of children\\u2019s vocabulary words by providing parents with specific scripted strategies on how to converse with their child about words found in the books before, during, and after the SBR session. By providing Latino parents with the tools necessary to enhance their home-literacy environment in their home language, the proposed intervention is expected to have a positive effect on children\\u2019s language outcomes.  The specific research questions sought to address are: 8. What are the effects of a Spanish home-based shared-book reading curriculum on standardized (ROWPVT) and researcher-developed (RDRVT) measures of Spanish receptive vocabulary? b. It is hypothesized that the children in the intervention group will obtain higher scores on the standardized and research developed receptive vocabulary tests in Spanish at post-test than children in the control group.  9. What are the effects of a Spanish home-based shared-book reading curriculum on standardized (EOWPVT) and researcher developed (RDEVT) measures of Spanish expressive vocabulary? Hypothesis b. It is hypothesized that children in the intervention group will obtain higher scores on the standardized and Researcher-Developed receptive vocabulary tests in Spanish at post-test than children in the control group.  \\n \\n 35 10. What are the effects of a Spanish home-based shared-book reading curriculum on children\\u2019s knowledge of Spanish Concepts About Print (RDCAPT)? Hypothesis b. It is hypothesized that children in the intervention group will obtain higher scores on the Spanish CAP task at post-test than children in the control group.  11. What are the effects of the Spanish home-based shared-book reading curriculum on children\\u2019s Spanish-language microstructure and macrostructure oral narrative skills? Hypotheses c. It is hypothesized that children in the intervention group will obtain higher scores on Spanish-language measures of productivity and grammatical complexity (microstructural narrative elements) at post-test than children in the control group.  d. It is hypothesized that children in the intervention group will obtain higher scores on measures of Spanish-language narrative organization, story grammar and coherence (macrostructure narrative elements) at post-test than children in the control group.  12. Assuming that the Spanish shared-book reading curriculum is effective in enhancing children\\u2019s vocabulary outcome skills (ROWPVT, RDRVT, EOWPVT, RDEVT) at post-testing, are the effects maintained at the 12-month follow-up? \\n \\n 36 Hypothesis  d. It is hypothesized that children in the intervention group will obtain higher scores on measures of vocabulary (expressive and receptive) at the 12-month follow-up than children in the control group.  13. Assuming that the Spanish shared-book reading curriculum was effective in enhancing children\\u2019s Spanish CAP skills at post-testing, are the effects maintained at the 12-month follow-up? Hypothesis  e. It is hypothesized that children in the intervention group will obtain higher scores on the CAP measure at the 12-month follow-up than children in the control group.  14. Assuming that the Spanish shared-book reading curriculum was effective in enhancing children\\u2019s microstructure and macrostructure oral narrative skills at post-testing, are the effect maintained at the 12-month follow-up? Hypothesis  f. It is hypothesized that children in the intervention group will obtain higher scores on measure of microstructure and macrostructure narrative elements at the 12-month follow-up testing than children in the control group.  It is hypothesized that statistical significant difference will be detected between groups on all child measures (vocabulary, CAP and oral narrative skills) at post-testing and at the 12-month follow-up. Past research has demonstrated that home-delivered SBR \\n \\n 37 interventions can enhance children\\u2019s oral language and literacy skills (Mol et al., 2008; Whitehurst, et al., 1998). These findings provide the foundation for the hypotheses for research questions 1 through 4. Specifically, findings from Roberts (2008) and Tsybina & Eriks-Brophy (2009) suggest that interactive SBR interventions in Spanish can be effective in increasing Spanish-speaking children\\u2019s vocabulary skills.      \\n \\n 38 CHAPTER III METHODS  Methods This study used existing data collected during the 2010-2011 and 2011-2012 academic years as part of two fellowship projects. These projects were funded by the Barbara Bush Texas Fund for Family Literacy and administered by the Texas Center for the Advancement of Literacy & Learning (TCALL) at Texas A&M University.  The data is divided in two phases.  In Phase I: Evaluation of the Spanish SBR curriculum, the effectiveness of the SBR curriculum in enhancing children\\u2019s oral language (vocabulary), oral narrative skills and knowledge about concepts of print were examined using pre/post-data. In Phase II: Post-intervention follow-up study, the effectiveness of the intervention on child outcome variables were examined using data collected at a 12-month follow up.  Participants Participants consisted of locally identified parent-child dyads. To be eligible to participate in Phase I of the study, parents-child had to be (a) of Latino origin and (b) speak Spanish.  Children had to be ages 4-5 without any significant developmental delays, language delays or health problems. The final sample consisted of twenty parent-child dyads.

This church was strategically selected as a recruiting site because it serves a large Latino and Spanish-speaking population. Recruitment efforts consisted of: a) Spanish language flyers inserted on weekly published bulletins, b) clergy announcements, c) a recruitment table located in the foyer of the church staffed by the principal investigator, and d) distribution of flyers outside of church. Through the recruitment strategies parents were informed of the purpose of the study, the activities they were going to be asked to do, duration of the study and the risks and benefits of participation.    Parents-child dyads who agreed to participate in phase 1 of the study, signed a consent form translated to Spanish. The recruitment goal was 20 parent-child dyads. Over the course of one weekend, 20 mother-child dyads were recruited but only 17 of these participants were reached via follow-up phone calls or met criteria for the study. Of the non-participants, one contact phone number was disconnected and two parents had children who did not meet eligibility criteria (one child had significant speech impairment and the other child was over the age criteria). Three additional parent-child dyads were recruited from the church, two prior to beginning of the study and one halfway into the study. In total, twenty-three informed consents were obtained for the study.  The final sample consisted of 20 Spanish-speaking mother-child dyads. All mothers reported being of Mexican descent and 90% reported having been born in Mexico. Of the mothers born in Mexico, the average time residing in the U.S. was 11 \\n \\n 41 years. On average, mothers were 30 years old with ages ranging from 17 to 39.  Fourteen of the mothers reported attending secondary and high school (70%), four reported an elementary education (20%) and two mothers reported having had attended technical school (10%).  Sixteen of the mothers reported speaking Spanish to their child (80%), while four reported speaking both Spanish and English (20%). All families reported yearly household income of less than $35,000. Table 1 presents detailed information on the mothers' level of education and other demographic information according to group membership.  At the beginning of the study, child participants ranged in age from 48 to 63 months with a mean age of 53 months. Sixteen children were attending a preschool program (80%) and the remainder attended an alternative day care setting or no day care. All children in the control group were enrolled in a preschool program. Two children in the intervention group and one from the control group had mild articulation difficulties (e.g., difficulty with word pronunciation) as reported by parents and observed by the principal investigator.  Procedures  Design Overview. This study utilized a between groups pre, post, and follow-up-test design to evaluate the effects of the Spanish SBR curriculum on child oral language and pre-literacy outcomes.   Phase 1: Evaluation of the Spanish SBR Curriculum. Following informed consent, eligible participants were assigned to receive training using a 12-week SBR curriculum (N=10) or a control group (N=10).  Random assignment was accomplished \\n \\n 42 by assigning participants to alternate groups in the order consent forms were received until each group contained 10 participants. Treatment parents were provided with a Spanish oral and written description of the project, followed by parent training on using the SBR curriculum in Spanish. Parents in the control group were contacted via phone calls to provide information about the project (e.g. delivery of books and duration of the project). Following parent information sessions, eligible children were scheduled for a battery of Spanish language and literacy measures. Assessments were conducted in the child\\u2019s home by the principal investigator, a bilingual school psychology doctoral student trained in bilingual assessment. Of the child participants, 18 were pre-tested one to two weeks prior to the intervention start and post-tested two weeks after the intervention ended. Due to phone disconnection, one control group mother-child dyad was delayed in their pretesting with the child tested two weeks into the project. The last mother-child dyad was recruited five weeks into the project; to accommodate the late start for this family, pre-testing was completed six weeks into the project. During pre-testing, parents were asked to complete questionnaires that asked demographic questions about their child and their family and home literacy practices. At post-testing, parents completed the questionnaire about home literacy practices and a consumer satisfaction questionnaire.  Intervention. The SBR curriculum for this study was an adapted from a home-based interactive SBR curriculum (Durodola et al., 2011) designed to accelerate vocabulary development while building background knowledge for children. The original curriculum is 13-weeks long and includes 26 books targeting science and social \\n \\n 43 studies concepts and vocabulary. Due to the discontinuation of three books, the curriculum was shortened to 12 weeks for this pilot study and 23 books were used. In total there were 46 scripted SBR sessions (12 week x 4 SBR sessions per week), two-scripted SBR for each book. During the course of the intervention, parents were asked to read to their child 4 times per week for a minimum of 15 minutes for each SBR session. The explicit scripted prompts and questions for each SBR session were designed to help parent engage in conversations with their children around words before, during and after reading using both fiction and non-fiction books that cover science and social studies concepts.  The modified curriculum was presented in a 3-ring binder with a calendar of the assigned books for each week, followed by the scripted SBR sessions. A practice sample of a scripted SBR session used for parent training can be found on Appendix A.  Two to three target words were presented on each SBR session (see Appendix B for list of targeted vocabulary words). Words were predominantly nouns. The selected words were used in the storybooks and depicted by an image. Specific scripted questions and prompts used during and after the reading focused discussion about the targeted words (see Appendix A for an example of questions). A small sticker with the image of a stop sign was also placed at the bottom of the page book where parents had to stop and discuss the words. This was done for each book in order to facilitate the process for the parents in the intervention group.  Parent training. After discussion, modeling and practice with one of the intervention developers, the principal investigator subsequently trained the parents in the \\n \\n 44 intervention group on the use of the 12-week SBR curriculum in Spanish. Two days prior to the beginning of the intervention, eight out of 10 participating mothers and the spouse of one of the mothers attended a two-hour group training session at the church facility (See Appendix C for training protocol). The remaining two mothers who were unable to make it to the group training received a one-hour one-to-one training in their home the day after the group training.  In the training, participants were informed of the benefits of SBR in developing children\\u2019s oral language and emergent literacy skills. Subsequently, mothers were introduced to the curriculum using a model-lead-test sequence in didactic practice with the principal investigator. Parents were also provided with general instructions including when to read, how to select an appropriate place to read, and how to sit with their child during their SBR sessions. To monitor treatment fidelity, participants were also informed and trained on how to complete a 4-item \\u201cLo Hicimos\\u201d checklist (See Appendix D) for each SBR session and how to use a digital audio recorder for recording selected SBR sessions (See Appendix E). Using the provided calendar, parents were instructed to record a particular session each week to monitor implementation fidelity (discussed below). Participants were instructed to carefully adhere to the curriculum and the calendar that outlined the books, dates and when to audio record.  Additionally, parents in the intervention were contacted via telephone calls on a weekly-basis by the investigator to answer questions. In the event of behavioral problems that interrupted the intervention, mothers were instructed to contact the \\n \\n 45 principal investigator. Two intervention mothers requested support in managing their children\\u2019s behavior during SBR. In each case, the principal investigator met with the parent in their home and together, they identified the problem, analyzed the problem behaviors, and identified a solution that would refocus the child on the shared-reading dialogues (e.g., using reinforces, decreasing distractions).  The books for the week were delivered weekly to parents at the church facility or in their homes. The control-group mothers were instructed to read to their children according to their usual practice via phone calls and during pre-data collection.  Fidelity of treatment implementation. To measure fidelity of implementation, parents in the intervention group were asked to complete a simple 4-item checklist for each shared-book reading session, for a total of 46 checklists (See Appendix D). The first item required parents to report the time they started reading and the time the session ended. This information was used to obtain information about the duration of their shared-book reading session. The other three items asked them to check \\u201cyes\\u201d or \\u201cno\\u201d if they engaged on the required activity: a) discussion before the reading, b) discussing during the reading and c) discussion after the reading. Parents were also instructed to audio-record 13 SBR sessions. For the first week, they were instructed to record two sessions to assist them in getting accustomed to using the audio recorder and one specified SBR session for the rest of the week.   Phase 2: Post-Intervention Follow-up Study. In phase 2 of the study (follow-up testing), parent-child dyads that completed phase 1 of the study (N=20) were invited to participate via a letter and through phone calls. Only 19 families were reached via \\n \\n 46 phone calls and home visits and 18 agreed to participate. In total, nine participants in each condition group completed phase 2 of the study. Following informed consent, the principal investigator met with participants in their home to complete follow-up testing. Child participants were tested on the same battery of measures utilized during pre and post testing. Parents were asked to complete a questionnaire to obtain demographic information about their family and current home literacy practices. At the end of the testing, to compensate participants for their time, parents received a $25 gift card to a local grocery store of their choice and children received two Spanish-English bilingual books.   General Procedures During Testing.  For the pre, post and follow-up testing, all, children were first administered the Researcher Developed Concept About Print Task (RDCAPT). This task was first administered in order to obtain a baseline for the child\\u2019s knowledge of print and reading conventions, in addition to build rapport with the child participant. All remaining tests were administered in counterbalanced fashion with both standardized and researcher developed expressive vocabulary measures administered prior to the receptive measures. Parents completed questionnaires while the principal investigator assessed children. Testing took place at the participants\\u2019 homes.   Measures  Family Demographic Questionnaire. At pre-test and follow-up testing, mothers were asked to complete a four-page questionnaire that requested general demographic information about them and their child. Items included age, place of birth, education level, income, language spoken in the home and participation in preschool, children\\u2019s \\n \\n 47 linguistic background such as language difficulties and exposure to Spanish and English at home.   The Familia Inventory. The home literacy environment was measured using questions from the Spanish version of the The Familia Inventory (Taylor, 1996). The original instrument consists of 57-items designed to assess 10 dimensions of the home literacy environment. For this study, a shorter version of the instrument was used consisting of 25 items as recommended by Gonzalez et al. (2011). In their study, they examined the psychometric properties of the instrument using an exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis. Results indicated that for the Spanish version, only 25 items contributed the most variance to two factors: the Family Shared Reading and Related Activities (19 items) and Library Use (6 items). The shorter version of the The Familia Inventory was administered at pre, post and follow-up testing. In this study, a Cronbach\\u2019s alpha reliability coefficient of .85 was obtained at pre-test and .93 at posttest for the 25 items, indicating adequate internal consistency.   ROWPVT-SBE (Receptive One-Word Picture Vocabulary Test: Spanish-Bilingual Edition; Brownell, 2001). The ROWPVT-SBE is a norm-referenced measure use by clinicians and researchers to assess language skills of individuals ages 4-12 who speak Spanish and English with varying levels of proficiency. Children were required to match a word presented orally in Spanish to one of four illustrations depicting an object, action or concept. The ROWPVT-SBE was administered at pre, post and follow-up testing. The internal consistency of the ROWPVT-SBE by age and grade is .96 to .97.  \\n \\n 48 EOWPVT-SBE (Expressive One-Word Picture Vocabulary Test: Spanish-Bilingual Edition; Brownell, 2001). The EOWPVT-SBE is a norm-referenced test designed to examine the expressive language ability of individuals ages 4-12 who speak Spanish and English with varying levels of proficiency. The EOWPVT-SBE was administered at pre, post and follow-up testing. Participants had to name colored illustrations depicting an object, action or concept in their preferred language.  Alpha reliability coefficients reported in the manual for the current sample age group range from .92 to .93.  RDRVT (Researcher-Developed Receptive Vocabulary Test (Pollard-Durodola et al., 2011). The RDRVT measure was adapted from a previous study. The original RDEPVT measure consisted of 17 items measuring children\\u2019s knowledge of targeted words. For this test, children were required to match a word presented orally in Spanish to one of four illustrations; all items were administered at pre, post and follow-up testing. For this study, five items were dropped from the Spanish and English measures, as they were not taught by the modified curriculum. The 12-targeted words assessed were: ra\\u00edz (root), tierra (earth), cajera (cashier), puente (bridge), verano (summer), valle (valley), nieve (snow), techo (roof), congelado (frozen), bosque (woods), cielo (sky) and tornado (tornado). These vocabulary words represented 23% of the targeted vocabulary taught in the intervention.  The internal consistency for the Spanish (RDRVT) measure at pre-test with the sample of 20 was found to be low, with Cronbach\\u2019s alpha coefficient of .47. The following items were removed to improve the reliability of the measure: congelado, \\n \\n 49 tierra and puente. The Cronbach\\u2019s alpha for the 9 remaining items improved to .60 for the pretest measure. The internal consistency for these 9-items remained stable at post-testing (Chronbach\\u2019s alpha = .65) with a sample of 20 and at follow-up (Chronbach\\u2019s alpha = .60) with a sample of 18.  RDEVT (Researcher-Developed Expressive Vocabulary Test (Pollard-Durodola et al., 2011). The RDEVT was also adapted from a previous study. This task requires children to provide the vocabulary word depicted by a colored illustration.  Similar to the RDRVT, this test consisted of 12 items. Items were scored using a scale from 0 to 2; a 0 indicated a vague or incorrect response; a 1 indicated an attribute of the target word (example: \\\"worker\\\" for the target word \\\"cashier\\\"); and a 2 indicated the use of the target word or a synonym.  The internal consistency for the Spanish (RDRVT) measure at pre-test with the sample of 20 was found to be low, with a Cronbach\\u2019s alpha coefficient of .39. Item-total statistics were reviewed to determine which items were affecting the reliability of the measure. The following items were removed to improve the reliability: puente, congelado, tierra and nieve. The Cronbach\\u2019s alpha for the 8 remaining items improved to .64 for the pretest measure. However, the internal consistency for these 8-items remained low at post-testing (Chronbach\\u2019s alpha = .45) with a sample of 20 and at follow-up (Chronbach\\u2019s alpha = .23) with a sample of 18.  Due to the measures\\u2019 low reliability at post-test and follow-up, it was removed from the outcome analyses. Researcher Developed Concept about Print Task (RDCAPT). For the purpose of the present study, the principal investigator developed an informal measure of \\n \\n 50 Concepts About Print (CAP) in Spanish to obtain information about children\\u2019s awareness of the form and function of print and reading conventions. This task is modeled after Clay\\u2019s CAP (1979) and Justice and Ezell\\u2019s PWA (2001) instrument. The present pilot measure consists of 15 items that are administered with the assistance of the book \\u00a1Tengo Sentimientos! (Hunter, 2001). The examiner followed a script to administer the tasks (see Appendix F). Children were assessed on their knowledge about book orientation, direction of print, differentiating print from illustrations and letter recognition. With the exception of 3 items, children\\u2019s responses were scored as correct (1 point) or incorrect (0). Three items were scored using a scale from 0-2; 0 indicated an incorrect response; 1 indicated partial correct response; and 2 indicated correct response. The maximum total points that could be obtained were 18. The RDCAPT was administered at pre, post and follow-up testing. The internal consistency for the CAP at pre-test with the sample of 20 was found to be acceptable, with Cronbach\\u2019s alpha coefficient of .68. Item-total statistics were reviewed to determine which items were affecting the reliability of the measure. Item number 14, which assessed children\\u2019s knowledge of capital letters (Can you point to the capital letter in this page?), was removed from the measure. Removing this item resulted in an improved Cronbach\\u2019s alpha (.71) for the remaining 14 items. However, the internal consistency for these 14 items at post-testing  (Cronbach\\u2019s alpha = .60) and follow-up testing (Cronbach\\u2019s alpha = .58) decreased. Parent Satisfaction Questionnaire. As a measure of social validity, a researcher-developed questionnaire was developed to assess parental satisfaction with \\n \\n 51 the project. Two versions of the Parent Satisfaction Questionnaire were created, one for the intervention group and one for the control group. For the intervention group, the questionnaire consisted of 16 items that assessed parents\\u2019 satisfaction with the SBR curriculum, training, books selected, perceived changes in their own SBR behaviors and perceived changes in their children\\u2019s oral language skills. Parents were also asked to list the strategies they learned from the curriculum, any changes they would like to see in the curriculum. Additionally, they were asked if they would recommend this curriculum to other parents. The questionnaire for the control group consisted of 14 items that asked similar questions; however, instead of asking about the curriculum, questions asked about the project. See the parent satisfaction questionnaires in Appendixes H and I.   Oral Narrative Production Tasks. Two tasks were used to elicit Spanish oral narrative samples from the participants at pre, post and follow-up testing. Using the commercially available wordless books illustrated by Mercer Mayer (1973, 1976), children were asked to retell a story and also to spontaneously tell a story. Clinicians and researchers have used these books extensively with a diverse group of children (e.g., Berman & Slobin, 1994; Pe\\u00f1a et al., 2006; Reilly et. al., 1998) to assess for productive language skills. Specific elicitation procedures were followed (see Appendix G). For the story-retell task, the examiner and child jointly preview pages of the wordless book titled Frog On His Own (Mayer, 1973). The pictures depict the adventures of a frog that escapes from his owner. Following the joint preview, the examiner read a scripted story adapted from the Systematic Analysis of Language Transcripts (SALT) computer software, version 2012 (SALT; Miller & Iglesias, 2012) Afterwards, the child was \\n \\n 52 prompted to retell the scripted story read by the examiner using the wordless book as a guide. If the child had difficulties, the examiner encouraged the child using scripted prompts.  For the story spontaneous task, the child was prompted to spontaneously tell a story in Spanish using the book One Frog Too Many (Mayer, 1991). Specifically, the examiner prompted the child to preview the pages of the book, and then asked the child to tell a story using the same book. If the examiner had difficulties in eliciting an oral narrative from the child, specific prompts were used to prompt the child to respond (See Appendix G). All stories were audio recorded using a digital recorder with an external microphone.  Qualitative Analyses of the Oral Narratives The oral narrative collected at pre-, post- and follow-up were transcribed verbatim and coded by two proficient Spanish-English bilingual research assistants blind to treatment group using the Systematic Analysis of Language Transcripts (SALT) computer software, version 2012 (SALT; Miller & Iglesias, 2012). Completed transcripts were analyzed for two specific microstructural oral narrative elements, the mean length utterance (MLU) and number of different words (NDW) used in their complete oral narrative sample.   Prior to transcribing, research assistants completed the IRB human subject training, a10-hour web training offered by the SALT program and a two-day training (total duration of 12 hours) with the principal investigator. Each research assistant received a data coding training manual (see Appendix J). During group training, research \\n \\n 53 assistants practiced transcribing sample audio-recordings, segmenting utterances and identifying bound morphemes using the SALT conventions. Prior to moving on to coding the assigned audio-recordings, each research assistant completed one practice transcription independently and obtained 85% agreement with the principal investigator. Each research assistant transcribed and coded half of the audio recordings independently (58 narratives). After the transcripts were completed and coded, the principal investigator listened to each audio recording following the transcripts to investigator for possible errors. Errors and disagreements on transcriptions were discussed with the rater until 100% agreement was reached.  Transcripts were also scored for story grammar components using the Narrative Structure Scheme (NSS; Heilmann, Miller, Nockerts, & Dunaway, 2010). The properties of the NSS have been examined with a sample of 129 children between the ages of 5 and 7 and found to be a useful tool to measure children\\u2019s narrative macrostructure elements (Heilmann, Miller, Nockerts & Dunaway, 2010). The NSS tool provides guidelines for measuring components of story grammar such as introduction, character development, mental and emotional states, referencing, conflict/resolution, cohesion and conclusion. Each story element is scored using a 0-5 scale, five for \\u201cproficient,\\u201d three for \\u201cemerging\\u201d or \\u201cinconsistent,\\u201d one for \\u201cimmature\\u201d or \\u201cminimal\\u201d and 0 for \\u201cnot present/or un-intelligible.\\u201d  A Spanish-English bilingual research assistant blind to treatment group underwent an extensive training over the course of three week (25 hours; see Appendix K for training manual) with the principal investigator on how to use the NSS scoring \\n \\n 54 rubric. The research assistant also practiced scoring stories obtained from the SALT website and archival date until 90% agreement with the principal investigator was obtained.  Then, the research assistant and principal investigator each independently scored all the stories collected at pretest (40 oral narratives), posttest  (39 oral narratives) and at follow-up testing (38 oral narratives). After the scoring was completed for all the pre-tests oral narratives, the raters met and reviewed disagreements (12%) until 100% consensus was achieved. The same procedure was conducted for the post-test narrative stories (18% disagreement were resolved) and follow-up narratives stories (14% disagreements were resolved).  Fidelity of Intervention Implementation  The fidelity of implementation analysis for the 4-item \\u201cLo Hicimos\\u201d checklist consisted of calculating the returned rate, the reported amount of time spent reading, and the average completion of the activities (before, during and after the reading). Parents returned 276 checklists, a returned rate of 60%.  To examine parents\\u2019 adherence to the SBR curriculum, a research assistant listened to all the audio-recordings completed by the participating parents (117 audio recordings, a completed rate of 90%) and used an implementation checklist (see sample, Appendix L) to determine parents\\u2019 adherence to the curriculum. Prior to listening to audio-recordings and completing the implementation checklist, the research assistant completed a two-hour training with the principal investigator to review the checklist. During the training period, the research assistant and principal investigator obtained 100% reliability when independently completing a checklist for one of the audio-\\n \\n 55 recording sessions.  A unique implementation checklist for all 46 SBR sessions used in the curriculum was created given that some parents recorded the wrong session or additional ones. The checklists were self-explanatory, as the research assistant had to give a score of 1 for presence of the scripted prompts and questions and a score of 0 for the absence of these. Additionally, the research assistant was asked to give a score of 1 when parents provided the opportunity for their child to answer the scripted questions and to write general comments about the SBR session (e.g. child appeared to be engaged; parent rushed through the reading). After the research assistant reviewed all the SBR audio recordings and the checklists, the principal investigator randomly selected 20% of the SBR audio recordings (24) and independently reviewed them following the implementation checklists. Inter-rater reliability was conducted using point-by-point agreement divided by total number of items. Accuracy was calculated to 98%.   \\n \\n 56 CHAPTER IV RESULTS  The present study used a pre-, post-between-groups design, with a 12-month follow-up to examine the effects of a Spanish language home-delivered parent-child shared-book reading curriculum on participating Spanish-speaking children\\u2019s oral language skills (vocabulary, mean length utterance), knowledge of concepts about print and oral narrative abilities. Group main effects were examined for pre-post data using ANCOVAs for all outcome variables. The long-term effects of the intervention were examined using 2 (group; intervention, control) x 3 (time; pre, post, follow-up) mixed design analysis of variance (ANOVAs) and ANCOVAs for pre-follow-up data. Data was analyzed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences 22 (SPSS). Outcome variables consisted of children\\u2019s performance on ten out of the eleven outcome test measured: two standardized vocabulary tests (EOWPVT; ROWPVT); two research developed vocabulary tests (RDRVT/RDEVT) and one research developed Spanish Concept About Print task (CAP). Additionally, children were administered two oral narrative tasks using wordless picture books (Story Retell & Story Spontaneous) to obtain two samples of their mean length utterance (MLU), two samples of their productive vocabulary (Number of Different Words Used in their narrative; NDW) and two samples of the quality of their narrative abilities using the commercially available story grammar instrument, the Narrative Scoring Scheme (NSS; Heilmann, Miller, Nockerts, & Dunaway, 2010).  These tasks were administered at pre and post-testing to \\n \\n 57 all children (N=20). At follow-up, two participants were not located; 18 participants completed follow-up outcome measures, nine participants in each condition.  It should be mentioned that the Researcher-Developed Expressive Vocabulary Test (RDEVT) was removed from the analyses due to its low reliability (see method section).   This chapter is organized in five sections. The first section provides preliminary analyses on initial pre-test difference between the intervention and control group on demographic and outcome variables. The second section presents information regarding the normality of the outcome data. The third section presents results for the outcome variables. The fourth section presents information about treatment implementation fidelity. This section addresses the intervention parents\\u2019 adherence to the Spanish shared-book reading curriculum and descriptive information on children\\u2019s performance based on dosage. The last section addresses the social validity of this study. In this section, descriptive information is provided about parents\\u2019 satisfaction with the project and information about their home-literacy practices at post-testing. This section also includes parents\\u2019 report on home literacy practices at follow-up.  Preliminary Analyses The data were first analyzed using independent sample t-tests and chi-square to ensure that the children in the control and intervention did not statistically differ on demographic variables, home literacy practices and outcome variables at pre-test. No group differences were found on any of the demographic variables or home literacy practices as measured by the Familia Inventory (a 25-item measured; Taylor, 1996; \\n \\n 58 Gonzalez et al., 2011). The groups did not statistically differ at pre-test. Table 2 provides descriptive statistics.

Analyses included examination of descriptive data, visual inspections of Q-Q plots and application of the Shapiro-Wilk\\u2019s tests (Shapirto & Wilk, 1965; Razali & Wah, 2011). At pre-test, skewness and kurtosis z-scores were within an appropriate range to suggest a normal distribution for all outcome variables. The Shapiro-Wilk\\u2019s tests were significant for two outcome variables (ROWPVT and the SS NSS), indicating violation of normality assumptions. For the remaining nine outcome variables, the Shapiro-Wilk\\u2019s tests suggested normal distributions. At post-test, skewness and kurtosis z-scores were within an appropriate range to suggest a normal distribution for 10 out of the 11 outcome variables. At follow-up, skewness and kurtosis z-scores and Shapiro Wilk\\u2019s tests were within an appropriate range to suggest approximation of a normal distribution for 10 out of the 11 outcome variables. The Shapiro-Wilk\\u2019s test for the RDRVT indicated that this variable was not normally distributed. In all cases, statistical procedures utilized are robust against violations of normality. Data was also inspected for outliers and it was determined that the identified outliers were not caused by a data entry error. Given the limitations of a small sample size and having an understanding of the robustness of the ANOVA and ANCOVAS to violations of normality assumptions, analysis were conducted without making any transformations of non-normal distributions. \\n \\n 60 Table 3  Descriptive Data and Shapiro Wilk's Test Scores for Pre, Post and Follow-up Outcome Variables  Pre-Test Outcome Variables  Intervention Group  N=10  Control Group  N=10  M  Skewness  Kurtosis Shapiro Wilk\\u2019s  M  Skewness  Kurtosis Shapiro Wilk\\u2019s ROWPVT 93.80 -1.19 -.20 .03  90.70 .19 -1.79 .19 EOWPVT 97.20 -0.54 -.67 .50  94.20 -.68 -1.13 .11 RDRVT 4.80 .14 .91 .09  3.90 .169 -1.34 .60 CAP 5.90 .79 -.36 .29  5.90 -.06 -.53 .63 SR MLU 4.66 .24 -.03 .17  5.56 -.52 .27 .93 SR NDW 42.60 -.30 -.58 .79  47.40 .71 .94 .68 SS MLU 5.23 -.57 -.98 .21  5.64 -.28 -.66 .57 SS NDW 43.60 .70 .65 .64  50.30 1.30 2.19 .27 SR NSS 8.70 -.16 -1.30 .41  12.50 .44 -.46 .51 SS NSS 8.60 .44 -1.42 .15  9.40 1.45 2.09 .04 Post-Test Outcome Variables Intervention Group  N=10  Control Group  N=9  M  Skewness Kurtosis Shapiro Wilk\\u2019s  M  Skewness Kurtosis Shapiro Wilk\\u2019s ROWPVT 108 -.41 -1.28 .34  97 -.62 .48 .45 EOWPVT 107 -.83 -.09 .31  100 .70 .33 .79 RDRVT 7.20 -.44 -.42 .15  4.70 .55 -.21 .52 CAP 11.80 -.25 .07 .91  8.60 -.85 -.21 .18 SR MLU 5.85 -.05 -.93 .72  5.17 -.50 -.75 .41 SR NDW 57.10 1.15 1.38 .49  51.20 -.25 -.83 .85 SS MLU 5.49 .09 -1.44 .66  5.61 -.33 -1.23 .69 SS NDW 51.00 .12 .66 .33  52.44 1.32 1.77 .12 SR NSS 16.50 8 .46 -1.19  14.60 .80 -.01 .21 SS NSS 13.00 5 .21 -.61  9.60 .00 1.09 .74     \\n \\n 61 Table 3 continued Follow-up Outcome Variables Intervention Group  N=9  Control Group  N=9  M  Skewness  Kurtosis Shapiro Wilk\\u2019s  M  Skewness  Kurtosis Shapiro Wilk\\u2019s ROWPVT 99.33 -.75 -.43 .41  98.00 -.19 -1.40 .66 EOWPVT 103.78 .22 -1.15 .66  103.44 -1.24 2.98 .23 RDRVT 8.22 -.50 -1.28 .13  6.77 -1.09 -.54 .01 CAP 14 -.19 -1.31 .16  14.55 .50 -1.27 .41 SR MLU 6.68 .71 -.07 .68  7.34 -1.38 2.48 .22 SR NDW 60.56 .41 -.68 .90  62.22 .63 -.85 .38 SS MLU 6.95 -.25 -.85 . 49  6.89 -.05 -1.56 .82 SS NDW 63.56 .28 -1.15 .72  64.78 .52 -.56 .63 SR NSS 18.78 -.23 -1.11 .42  20 .25 .27 .99 SS NSS 15.66 .04 -1.55 .52  17.55 -.69 -.94 .11 Note.

Outcome Analyses  Research questions 1-4 addressed whether or not the Spanish home-based shared-book reading curriculum would yield statistically significant positive effects on the 11 child outcome variables at post-test. It was hypothesized that children in the intervention group would out-perform their peers at post-testing on all child outcome variables. These questions were analyzed using a one-way between-groups analysis of covariance (ANCOVAs). The independent variable was the group membership (intervention or control) and the dependent variable consisted of the post-test scores on 10 child outcomes (the RDEVT outcome variable was removed for its low reliability). Pre-test outcome scores were used as the covariate in these analyses. Prior to conducting \\n \\n 62 the ANCOVAs, homogeneity-of-regression assumptions for each variable were examined. In the present data the interaction effect was not significant for any of the variables indicating that the relationship between the covariate (pre score for each outcome variable) and the dependent variables (post score for each outcome variable) did not differ significantly as a function of the independent variable. Next, results of the ANCOVAs are organized by research question.   Research Question 1   What are the effects of a Spanish home-based shared-book reading curriculum on standardized (ROWPVT) and Spanish researcher-developed measures of receptive vocabulary (RDRVT)? The ANCOVA for the ROWPVT did not meet the homogeneity of variances assumption as assessed by Levene's test (p = .016). Results are presented but should be interpreted with caution. The ANCOVA revealed significant group effect F(1, 17) = 5.70; p = .03.  Follow-up tests were conducted to evaluate pairwise differences among the adjusted means for groups. The Bonferroni correction was used to control for Type I error across the 2 pairwise comparisons. The results showed that children in the intervention group (M = 107.31; SE = 2.87) had significantly higher scores on the ROWPVT, controlling for the effects of pre-test, than children in the control group (M = 97.69; SE = 2.87). The effect size was ES = 0.25.  The ANCOVA for the RDRVT met the homogeneity of variances assumption as assessed by the Levene's test (p = .29). Results revealed significant group effect F(1, 17) = 9.81; p = .006. Post hoc analysis was conducted to evaluate pairwise differences \\n \\n 63 among the adjusted means for groups using the Bonferroni correction. Children in the intervention group (M = 7.06; SE = .49) had significantly higher scores on the RDRVT, controlling for the effects of pre-test, than children in the control group (M = 4.84; SE = .49). The effects size for the intervention group was ES = 0.37. The results of both of these ANCOVAs showed that children in the intervention group outperformed their peers at post-testing on the ROWPVT and RDRVT, which is evidence of a positive effect for the parent-delivered Spanish shared-book reading intervention. Table 4 presents the results of the ANCOVAs.   Research Question 2  What are the effects of a Spanish home-based shared-book reading curriculum on the standardized (EOWPVT) and researcher developed measures of expressive vocabulary in Spanish (RDEVT)? The ANCOVA for the EOWPVT met the homogeneity of variances assumption as assessed by Levene's test (p = .68). Results for the EOWPVT did not reveal a significant group effect F(1, 17) = 2.73; p = .12. Due to the low-reliability of the RDEVT measure, this outcome variable was removed from all outcome analyses.  Research Question 3  What are the effects of a Spanish home-based shared-book reading curriculum on children\\u2019s knowledge of Spanish Concepts About Print (RDCAPT)? The ANCOVA for the RDCAPT met the homogeneity of variances assumption as assessed by Levene's test (p = .07). Results revealed a significant group effect F(1, 17) = 9.98; p = .006. Post hoc tests were conducted to evaluate pairwise differences among \\n \\n 64 the adjusted means for groups. The Bonferroni correction was used to control for Type I error across the 2 pairwise comparisons. The results showed the children in the intervention group (M = 11.80; SE = .72) had significantly higher scores on the Spanish CAP when controlling for the effects of pre-test, than children in the control group (M = 8.60; SE = .72). The effect size was ES = 0.24.  Research Question 4   What are the effects of the Spanish home-based shared-book reading curriculum on microstructure and macrostructure narrative elements? The microstructure variables consisted of children\\u2019s mean length utterance (MLU) and a count of the diversity of words (Number of Different Words; NDW) used in their oral narrative samples. For one task, children were asked to retell a story (SR) with the assistance of a wordless picture book (see methods section for description). For the second task, children were given a different wordless picture book and asked to spontaneously tell a story (SS). For each narrative sample an obtained MLU and NDW was calculated. Due to an audio-recording error, there is missing data for one control participant for the spontaneous story task. In other words, the MLU and NDW were unable to be calculated for this participant at this time point and therefore, this participant was excluded from the analysis.  All the ANCOVAs met the homogeneity of variances assumption as assessed by Levene's test. Results only revealed a significant group effect for the SR MLU F(1, 17) = 6.00; p = .02 (See Table 4). Post hoc tests were conducted to examine for pairwise differences among the adjusted means for groups. The Bonferroni correction was used to \\n \\n 65 control for Type I error across the 2 pairwise comparisons. Children in the intervention group (M = 6.19; SE =.39) had significantly higher scores on the SR MLU after controlling for the effects of pre-test, than children in the control group (M = 4.83; SE =.39). The effects size was E = 0.26. The macrostructure analysis examined the quality of children\\u2019s narrative on the two tasks (Story Retell (SR) and Story Spontaneous (SS)). Children\\u2019s narratives were examined on seven categories using the Narrative Scoring Scheme (NSS) and a total score was calculated. The maximum score possible was 35.  Both of the ANCOVAs met the homogeneity of variances assumption as assessed by Levene's test. Results revealed a significant group effect for both, the SR NSS F(1, 17) = 6.81; p = .018 and the SS NSS F(1, 17) = 9.17; p = .01. Post hoc tests were conducted to evaluate pairwise differences among the adjusted means for groups for each ANCOVA. The results showed that children in the intervention group obtained significantly higher scores on the SR NSS (M =18.79; SE =1.69) and SS NSS (M=13.35, SE = .96), after controlling for the effects of pre-test, than children in the control group (M = 12.30, SE = 1.69; M = 9.25, SE = .96, respectively). The effects sizes for the SR NSS were ES = 0.29 and ES = 0.35 for the SS NSS. This result provides partial support for the positive effect of the Spanish shared-book reading curriculum on children\\u2019s oral language narrative skills.\\n \\n 66 Table 4  Results of One-Way ANCOVAs Conducted for All Post Outcome Variables    Adjusted Mean  F p \\u03b72  Intervention Control     ROWPVT  107.31 97.69 5.70 .029 .25 EOWPVT 106.27 101.12 2.73 .117 .14 RDRVT 7.06 4.84 9.81 .006 .37 RDCAPT 11.80 8.60 9.98 .006 .37 SR MLU 5.85 5.17 6.00 .025 .26 SS MLU 5.49 5.61 .33 .576 .02 SR NDW 57.10 51.20 3.50 .08 .17 SS NDW 51.00 52.44 .305 .59 .02 SR NSS 16.50 14.60 6.81 .018 .29 SS NSS 13.00 9.60 9.17 .008 .35 Note.

Research Questions 5-7 Research questions 5 to 7 related to the long-term effects of the intervention over a 12-month follow-up period. It was hypothesized that children in the intervention would maintain a significant advantage over the control group at a12-month follow-up on the previously identified and statistically significant post-test outcomes. Since at post-testing children in the intervention group only outperformed their peers in the control group on six out of the 10 outcome variables examined, these outcome variables were analyzed using 2 (group; intervention, control) x 3 (time, pre, post, follow-up) mixed design \\n \\n 67 analyses of variance (ANOVAs, Wilks\\u2019 Lambada). Group condition (intervention, control) served as the between-subjects variable and time (pretest, posttest and 12-month follow up test) served as the within-subjects variable. Table 5 presents outcome scores for each group at each time point. It should be noted that these analyses were conducted with data for eighteen out of the original twenty participants (9 participants in each condition). At follow-up, one participant from the intervention group could not be located and one mother participant from the control group refused to participate.  Before the repeated measures of ANOVA were conducted, assumptions of Homogeneity of Variance and Sphericity were examined. To examine the assumption of homogeneity of variance, Box\\u2019s M Test of Equality of Covariance Matrices was conducted. This helps determine if outcome variables selected for analysis are equal across the groups (intervention or control). Assumptions of homogeneity of variance were met for all variables. Analysis of variance also requires that that the variances of the differences for all pairs of repeated measures are equal (Sphericity Assumption). Violations of the assumption are only problematic if the null hypothesis has been rejected. This assumption was examined using Mauchly\\u201fs Test of Sphericity. Assumptions of Sphericity were also met for all variables. Results are presented by research question.\\n \\n 68 Table 5  Group Means at Pre, Post, and 12-Month Follow-up (with Standard Deviations in Parentheses)   Intervention  M (SD)  Control M (SD) Outcome Variable Pre N =10 Post N =10 Follow-Up N =9  Pre  N =10 Post N =10 Follow-Up N =9 ROWPVT 93.80 (13.20) 108  (6.91) 99.33 (12.81)  90.70 (9.44) 97.00 (12.59) 98.00  (4.64) EOWPVT 97.20  (11.95) 107  (10.91) 103.78 (6.89)  94.20 (12.73) 100.40 (6.48) 103.44 (4.72) RDRVT 4.80  (2.04) 7.20  (1.39) 8.22  (.83)  3.90  (2.02) 4.70  (1.83) 6.78 (1.72) RDCAPT 5.90  (4.04) 11.80  (2.04) 12.60  (5.32)  5.90  (2.28) 8.60  (3.09) 14.56  (1.66) SR MLU 4.65  (1.97) 5.85  (2.17) 7.33  (1.33)  5.56  (1.40) 5.16  (1.14) 6.68  (.97) SS MLU 5.23  (1.89) 5.49  (1.93) 6.95  (1.16)  5.64  (1.42) 5.61  (1.22) 6.89  (.84) SS NDW 42.60  (14.26) 57.10  (15.11) 60.55 (11.84)  47.40 (15.72) 51.20 (11.65) 62.22  (7.17) SR NDW 43.60  (16.79) 51.00  (10.72) 63.55 (17.06)  50.30 (18.94) 52.44 (13.26) 64.78 (11.82) SR NSS  8.70  (4.03) 16.50  (7.62) 18.77  (4.26)  12.50 (5.08) 14.60  (7.24) 20  (3.87) SS NSS 8.60  (5.42) 13.00  (5.87) 15.66  (5.31)  9.40  (5.08) 9.60  (5.10) 17.56  (5.59) Note.

Were the effects of the Spanish shared-book reading intervention on the vocabulary outcome measures maintained at the 12-month post-test follow-up?  Children in the intervention group statistically outperformed their peers in the control group at post-testing on the ROWPVT and RDRVT, therefore, these outcome variables were included in the analysis.  ROWPVT. Results of the 2 (group: intervention, control) x 3 (time: pre, post, follow-up) Mixed ANOVA revealed a main effect for time, F(2, 16) = 9.45, p = .001, partial eta squared = . 37. No main effect for group or interaction effect for group by time were observed (See Table 6). Results indicate that all participants made gains over time regardless of group membership. This suggests that the intervention effects for the ROWPVT were not maintained at follow-up. As can be seen on Figure 1, children in the control group made progress over time and almost caught up to the intervention group at follow-up.  RDRVT. Results of the 2 (group: intervention, control) x 3 (time: pre, post, follow-up) Mixed ANOVA revealed a significant main effect for time, F(2, 16) = 19.54, p = .000, partial eta squared = . 55 and group, F(2, 16) = 9.66, p = .007, partial eta squared = . 37. No interaction effect for group by time was observed (See Table 6). All children in the study made gains over time regardless of group membership, suggesting that the intervention effects for the RDRVT were not maintained at follow-up. However, children in the intervention group obtained higher scores but their growth trajectory was \\n \\n 70 not statistically significant from that of their peers in the control group.  Refer to Figure 2.   Research Questions 6. Were the effects of a Spanish SBR curriculum on the Spanish CAP outcome measures maintained at the 12-month follow-up?   Children in the intervention group statistically outperformed their peers in the control group at post-testing on the Spanish CAP task and therefore, this variable was included in the analyses. Results of the 2 (Group) x 3 (Time) Mixed ANOVA revealed a Time x Group interaction effect, F(2, 16) = 7.29, p = .002, \\u03b72= . 31. These results indicated a large-size effect for the Time x Group control, suggesting that children in the control group outperform their peers in the intervention group at the 12-month follow-up. Results were contrary to the hypothesis; the effects of the intervention faded at a 12-month follow up. Refer to Figure 3.  Research Question 7. Were the effects of the Spanish SBR curriculum on the microstructural and macrostructural oral narrative outcome variables maintained at the 12-month post-test follow-up?   Children in the intervention group statistically outperformed their peers on the story retell task for MLU (SR MLU) and on their quality of their narrative (NSS) for both oral narrative tasks, Story Retell (SR) and Story Spontaneous (SS).  These three outcome variables were included in the analyses.  Story Retell MLU. Results of the 2 (Group) x 3 (Time) Mixed ANOVA showed a significant main effect for time, F(2, 16) = 17.53, p = .000, partial eta squared = . 52. This indicates that regardless of group membership, children acquired language gains \\n \\n 71 over time. Results approximated an interaction effect for group by time F(2, 16) = 2.99, p = .065, partial eta squared = .16, indicating that the gains observed over time appeared to be partially accounted for by group membership. In an absolute terms, although non-significant, children in the intervention group obtained higher average MLU scores at post and follow-up testing than their peers in the control group. Refer to Figure 4. Story Retell Narrative Scoring Scheme (SR NSS). Results of the 2 (Group) x 3 (Time) Mixed ANOVA showed a significant main effect for time, F(2, 16) = 24.43, p = .000, partial eta squared = .60. This indicates that all participants showed growth over time. No main effect for group or Time x Group interaction effect were observed. Contrary to the hypothesis, Figure 5 indicates that children in the control group outperformed their peers in the intervention group at follow-up testing.  Spontaneous Story Narrative Scoring Scheme (SS NSS). Results of the ANOVA showed a significant Time x Group interaction, F(2, 16) = 4.32, p = .025, partial eta squared = . 21. These results indicated a moderate interaction effect, attributed primarily to the large follow-up difference in quality of narrative performance for the control group (M= 17.55; SE = 1.82) versus intervention group (M= 15.67; SE = 1.82). Results indicate that children in the control group made significant gains over time outperforming their peers in the intervention group at follow-up testing.

A 2 (Group) x3 (Time) Mixed ANOVA for SS NSS    Secondary Analyses   Secondary analyses were conducted to compare group performance from pre-test to follow-up for all variables using a one-way between-groups analysis of covariance (ANCOVAs). Pre-test child outcome scores were used as the covariate in this analysis. Table 7 presents the results of these analyses.  Results only revealed a significant group effect for the Story Retell Mean Length Utterance (SR MLU), F(1, 17) = 10.37; p = .05. Post hoc tests were conducted to evaluate pairwise differences among the adjusted means for groups. The Bonferroni \\n\\n \\n 79 correction was used to control for Type I error across the 2 pairwise comparisons. Children in the intervention group (M = 7.47; SE =. 31) had significantly higher scores on the SR MLU Follow-up task after controlling for the effects of pre-test, than children in the control group (M = 6.54; SE =.39). The effects size was E = 0.23. This suggests that the MLUs of children in the intervention were statistically significantly larger in comparison to that of their control peers.

Parents were asked to complete a simple 4-item checklist for each shared-book reading session, for a total of 46 checklists. The first item required parents to report the duration of their shared-book reading session. The other three items asked them to check \\u201cyes\\u201d or \\u201cno\\u201d if they engaged on the required activity: a) discussion before the reading, b) discussing during the reading and c) discussion after the reading. In total, the group returned 276 checklist, a return rate of 60%. On average, parents reported that their shared-book reading session lasted 15 minutes. For the checklist returned, parents reported having completed discussions before, during and after the reading session (100%). One parent participant failed to complete the checklist, and thus the information obtained reflects the self-report of 9 intervention parents.  The second method used to examine treatment implementation fidelity was through an evaluation of parent-child shared-book reading audio recordings. Parents were instructed to record two reading sessions one for the first week of treatment and one, each, for the duration of the intervention for a total of 13. In total, the group completed 117 audio recordings, a completed rate of 90%. Table 8 summarizes fidelity information for each participant and for the group. As can be seen in Table 8, only 5 participants completed all the required audio recordings. Contrary to parent report on the checklist about amount of time spent reading, when audio recordings were reviewed, findings indicated that only for 4 parents were reading the minimum suggested time (15 \\n \\n 81 minutes). The other 6 parents\\u2019 average reading time ranged from 10 to 14 minutes. As a group, on average, shared book reading sessions lasted M =14 minutes. Regarding adherence to the curriculum, audio recordings were examined for parents\\u2019 use of the scripted curriculum prompts and questions at the beginning, during and after the reading. Adherence percentages were calculated for each audio-recording session on the different sections (discussion before, during, after) and averaged for a total performance score.  As a group, on average, parents used the scripted prompts and questions before, during and after the reading 67% of the time.  However, variability of performance was observed. Five parents demonstrated high adherence to the shared-book reading curriculum and obtained an average total performance of 84% and higher. Two parents adhered to some portions of the curriculum and obtained an average total performance of 62% and 78%, respectively. Three parents obtained low average performance (29% and below). These three parents failed to use the scripted discussion questions during and after the reading. Although there was variability on the fidelity of intervention (e.g. using the scripted questions during their shared-book reading session), it was noted that in general, parents engaged in discussion about targeted and non-targeted words. It is possible that the \\u201cStop\\u201d stickers placed at the bottom of the targeted pages of each book, prompted parents to discuss the targeted words. In summary, the results of the fidelity of implementation analysis suggests that all child intervention participants were exposed to the books and portions of the curriculum, but only half of these participants received the intervention as it was intended.  \\n \\n 82 Table 8  Descriptive Information of Parents' Fidelity of Intervention Implementation  Participant Recordings Averaged Reading Time  (Range) Discussion Before  SBR (Range) Discussion During SBR\\u2013 Average Score (Range) Discussion After SBR\\u2013 Average Score (Range) Averaged Total Score 1 12 15 minutes (13-20) 80% (17-100) 85% (0-100) 88% (43-100) 84% (54-100) 2 13 14 minutes (12-19) 40% (17-100) 57% (0-100) 14% (4-100) 29% (4-94) 3 12 10 minutes (6-14) 62% (17-100) 34% (0-100) 74% (0-100) 62% (19-91) 4 13 15 minutes (9-21) 90% (50-100) 98% (71-100) 86% (0-100) 90% (50-100) 5 7 13 minutes (6-22) 39% (17-50) 53% (14-100) 0% 19% (9-25) 6 8 13 minutes (7-19) 94% (80-100) 96% (71-100) 94% (78-100) 93% (81-100) 7 13 17 minutes (14-25) 97% (83-100) 95% (43-100) 99% (89-100) 98% (81-100) 8 13 23 minutes (12-30) 89% (50-100) 100%  94% (75-100) 91% (78-100) 9 12 11 minutes (5-21) 80% (63-100) 95% (43-100) 72% (0-100) 78% (50-100) 10 14 14 minutes (6-22) 38% (10-75) 71% (14-100) 7% (0-78) 25% (9-78) Group    117    14 minutes (10-23) 71% (38-97) 78% (53-100) 63% (7-99) 67% (25-98) \\n \\n 83 To explore how different levels of intervention adherence (high, moderate, low) related to the child\\u2019s performance on the outcome variables, a descriptive analysis was conducted. The levels were determined by dividing scores into thirds. Table 9, presents the information. As can be seen, children (N=3) who received the intervention with high fidelity obtained higher scores on most outcome variables at post and follow-up. The exception to this pattern of performance occurred when measuring the diversity of words used in their narrative samples (NDW). This exploratory information suggests that adherence to intervention implementation related to children\\u2019s performance on the outcome variables.

Social Validity Analyses All participating parents completed a parent satisfaction survey administered at post-testing (to evaluate social validity). Two versions of the survey were developed, one for the intervention group and one for the control group. The version for the intervention group consisted of 16 likert-type items and the survey for the control group consisted of 14 likert-type questions. The version for the intervention parents asked about their satisfaction with the parent-training, the curriculum and book selection and if they would recommend the curriculum to other parents. Intervention parents were also asked about their perception of change in their children\\u2019s language, and their and their \\n \\n 85 children\\u2019s enjoyment in shared-book reading following the intervention. Additionally, parents were asked to identify three strategies they learned during the course of the project. Table 10 shows intervention parents\\u2019 responses to selected questions.  Results suggested that the intervention parents were satisfied with the training provided on how to the use the shared-book reading curriculum. All parents reported that they would recommend the curriculum to other parents and 80% reported that it was likely for them to continue to use the strategies learned in their future shared-book reading sessions. Eighty percent of the parents reported that they found the curriculum easy to use. One parent found the curriculum difficult to use and one reported neutral opinion. Seventy percent of the parents reported that it was not difficult for them to read to their child four times per week, as required by the curriculum, but 30% of the parents did.  The majority of the parents (90%) reported that they and their child liked the books used in the curriculum and that the vocabulary chosen in the curriculum was appropriate for their child (80%).   Regarding perceive changes, the majority of the parents (90%) reported that their child seemed to talk more during shared-book reading and that they and their child enjoy reading more than they did prior to participation in the intervention.  Finally, 60% parents were able to correctly describe at least one strategy taught in the curriculum for discussion before the reading and during the reading. However, only 20% of the parents were able to describe at least one strategy taught in the curriculum for discussion after the reading.\\n \\n 86 Table 10  Intervention Parents' Responses to Satisfaction Questionnaire  Item Strongly Agree /Agree Neutral Disagree/Strongly Disagree Satisfaction with the parent training  The training helped me during my shared-book reading sessions 100%   Satisfaction with the Spanish-Shared-book reading curriculum I would recommend the shared-book reading curriculum to other parents. 100%   It was difficult to use the curriculum. 10% 10% 80% It was difficult to read to my child 4 times per week. 20% 10% 70% I liked the books used in the shared-book reading curriculum 100%   My child liked the books used in the shared-book reading curriculum. 90% 10%  I am likely to continue to use the strategies learned with the SBR curriculum when I read to my child. 90% 10%  The vocabulary used in the shared-book reading curriculum was appropriate for my child. 80% 20%  Perception of intervention changes  More Less Same Following the intervention, my child seems to talk ____ than he he/she did before the project. 90%  10% Following the intervention, my child enjoys reading ____ than before the project. 90%  10% During the course of the intervention, I\\u2019ve enjoyed reading with my child ____ than before the project. 90%  10% Books in the home and reading practices  Before the Project Mean (Range)  After the Project Mean (Range) Number of child books at home 11. 37 (1-30):   30 (25-30) Number of adult books at home 9.33 (0-30)  10.44 (0-30) Frequency of shared-book reading per week 2.3 (0-6)  4.2 (1-7) Frequency of adult reading per week  3.22 (0-7)  4.33 (1-7) Self-Report of type of strategies learned during the curriculum  Percentage of parents who described at least 1 strategy in this category Strategy(ies) for discussing the book before the reading (e.g. introduce the title, introduce the story, ask child to predict what the story will be about, allow child to look at the pages) 60% Strategy(ies) for discussion during the reading (e.g. asking questions, explaining vocabulary, asking questions about vocabulary) 60% Strategy(ies) for discussion after the reading (e.g. discussing what the book was about, discussing vocabulary, asking questions about real-life) 20%   \\n \\n 87 Parents in the control groups reported strong satisfaction with their participation and all indicated that they would recommend the project to other parents. Please refer to table 11. All parents reported having liked the books used in the project and 90% percent reported that their child also liked the books used. Regarding shared-book reading practices used during the course of the project, 40% of parents reported having read to their child 1 to 2 times per week, 30% reported having read 3-4 times per week and 30% reported having read daily. Seventy percent of the parents reported that their shared-book reading sessions lasted 20 to 30 minutes, and the rest of the parents reported that their sessions lasted 15 minutes (10%) or between 5 and 10 minutes (20%).  Parents were also asked about strategies used in their reading. Sixty percent reported having used closed-ended questions (e.g. what is this?) and engaging in discussion of word during their shared-book reading session. Fifty percent of parents also reported having used open-ended questions (e.g. why?) and questions that went beyond the reading. Forty percent reported having had discussion about the title of the book and 30% reported having engaged in discussion after the reading. Noticeably, less than 50% of parents engaged in discussion before the reading or after the reading.  Regarding perceived changes, the majority of the parents reported that their child seemed to talk more during shared-book reading and that they and their child enjoyed reading more than they did prior to participation in the project.        \\n \\n 88  Table 11  Control Parents' Responses to Satisfaction Questionnaire  Item Strongly Agree /Agree Neutral Disagree/Strongly Disagree Satisfaction with the project  The shared-book reading project helped me during my shared-book reading sessions. 100%   I would recommend the shared-book reading project to other parents. 100%   I liked the books used in the shared-book reading curriculum 100%   My child liked the books used in the shared-book reading curriculum. 90% 10%  Parent report about reading practices during the course of the project  1-2 Times Per Week 3-4 Times Per Week Daily During the course of the project (12 weeks), I read to my child approximately___ times per week. 40% 30% 30%  5-10  Minutes 15  Minutes 20-30 Minutes During the course of the project (12 weeks), I read each book for approximately ____ minutes. 20% 10% 70% Perception of changes as a result of participation in the project  More Less Same Following the project, my child seems to talk ____ than he he/she did before the project. 90% 10%  Following the project, my child enjoys reading ____ than before the project 100%   Following the project, I\\u2019ve enjoyed reading with my child ____ than before the project. 90%  10% Books in the home and reading practices  Before the Project Mean (Range)  After the Project Mean (Range) Number of child books at home 5.88 (0-10)  31 (24-36) Number of adult books at home 4.4 (0-15)  6.7 (2-20) Frequency of shared-book reading per week 3 (0-7)  6.11 (5-7) Frequency of adult reading per week  2.22 (0-7)  5.67 (1-7) Parent report about shared-book reading strategies used during the course of the project  Percentage Discussion about the title.  40% Asked open-ended questions 50% Asked Closed-ended questions during the reading. 60% Discussion of words during the reading. 60% Discussion After the Reading. 30% Asked Questions that went beyond the reading.  50%  \\n \\n 89 Follow-up Parent Survey  At follow-up, all parents completed a questionnaire that asked about their child and adult books found in the home and their current home literacy practices (e.g. frequency of shared book reading, adult reading). The questionnaire also asked about parents\\u2019 and their child\\u2019s enjoyment of shared-book reading and for parents to describe the shared-book reading strategies they were currently using.  Table 12 presents parents\\u2019 responses to selected questions.  Reported number of child books ranged from five to 60 with the intervention group reporting an average of 34 and 23 for the control group. Reported number of adult books in the home ranged from 0 to 25 with an average of seven for parents in the intervention group and 12 for the control group. Regarding current shared-book reading practices, both groups reported reading close to 4 times per week with a range of response from 0 to 7 for the intervention group and a range from 1 to 7 for the control group. Noticeably, this is a decrease of frequency of shared-book reading from their report at post-testing. Regarding the averaged time for their shared-book reading session, 75% of parents in the intervention group reported that their sessions lasted between 10 and 15 minutes and 25% reported that their sessions lasted between 20-30 minutes. Forty-five percent of parents in the control report reading for 10-15 minutes and 44% reported reading for 20-30 minutes. Reported child and adult enjoyment of reading varied, but noticeably, 33% of parents in the intervention group reported that their child had little enjoyment. The findings of this questionnaire will be discussed in Chapter 5.   \\n \\n 90 Table 12  Parent Report About Home Literacy Practices at the 12-Month Follow Up  Number of books at home and reading practices  Intervention (N=9) M (Range)  Control (N=9) M (Range) Number of child books at home 34 (15-60):   23 (5-50) Number of adult books at home 7 (0-20)  12 (0-25) Frequency of shared-book reading per week 3.7 (0-7)  4 (1-7) Frequency of adult reading per week  3 (0-7)  5 (1-7) How many times per week does your child asks you to read to him/her? 4 (0-7)  4  (1-7) Time Spent Reading to Child  0-5 Minutes 10-15  Minutes 20-30 Minutes 31 or more Minutes Control 0% 75% 25% 0% Intervention 11% 45% 44% 0% How much does your child enjoy the shared-book reading Does not enjoy it Very little Somewhat Enjoys it a lot Intervention 11% 33% 33% 22% Control 0% 11% 33% 56% How much do your enjoy reading?

Most of the existent studies have been conducted with Caucasian families and in English (Manz, Hughes, Barnabas, Bracaliello, & Ginsburg-Block, 2010; Perry, Kay, & Brown, 2008), leaving a gap in the literature about the effectiveness of SBR interventions for Spanish-speaking Latino families in the U.S. The present pilot study addresses this gap by examining the effectiveness of a parent-delivered 12-week SBR curriculum in Spanish on participating Spanish-speaking children\\u2019s oral language skills (generalized and targeted vocabulary), knowledge of concepts about print (CAP) and microstructural and macrostructural oral narrative abilities. These skills were selected based on evidence demonstrating the potential positive impact of SBR on vocabulary, (Mol, Bus, De Jong, & Smeets, 2008), knowledge about concepts about print (NELP, 2009) and oral narrative skills (Crain-Thoreson, Notari-Syverson, & Cole, 1996; Lever and S\\u00e9n\\u00e9chal, 2011; Zevenbergen, Whitehurst, & Zevenbergen, 2003).  The pilot study used a pre-, post-between-groups with a 12-month follow-up test design. Participants were 20 low-income Spanish-speaking mothers tethered to their young children, with 10 SBR dyads and 10 typical practice dyads. At the 12-month \\n \\n 92 follow-up, only 18 of the original participants took part of the study, 9 dyads in each group. The SBR Spanish curriculum used in this study was adapted from a multi-component vocabulary and knowledge-building curriculum delivered in the context of story read-alouds in the schools and in the homes (Pollard-Durodola et al., 2012). The curriculum was 12-weeks long and included 52 scripted SBR sessions to be used with 26 specific Spanish books (2 scripted sessions for each book). Parents in the control group were given the same books during the course of the intervention but did not receive guidance or scaffolding on how to conduct their SBR sessions at home. At the end of the study, parents in the control group received a copy of the SBR reading curriculum and a brief overview on how to use it.  It was hypothesized that children exposed to the interactive scripted Spanish-language SBR curriculum that incorporated rich and repeated language opportunities around cognitively complex questioning before, during and after reading, would develop greater growth in their oral language skills, knowledge about reading conventions and print awareness, as well oral narrative abilities. Seven research questions were investigated in this pilot study. Research questions 1-4 addressed whether or not a Spanish home-based shared-book reading had positive effects on all child outcome variables at post-test. It was hypothesized that children in the intervention group would out-perform their peers at post-testing on all child outcome variables. Research questions 5 to 7 related to the long-term effects of the intervention at a 12-month follow-up period-a question of durability of the intervention. It was hypothesized that children in the intervention would maintain a significant advantage over the control group at a12-month \\n \\n 93 follow-up on all child outcome variables.  Out of the original ten outcome variables proposed to be examined, nine were included in the final outcome analyses due to the low reliability of one measure (Researcher-Developed Expressive Vocabulary Test (RDEVT); refer to the method section). Results showed partial support for the hypotheses. Results from the ANCOVA examining group differences on post-test scores while controlling for pre-test scores, indicated that the intervention positively impacted children\\u2019s performance on six outcome variables. Children in the intervention group obtained significantly higher scores on a Spanish generalized receptive vocabulary measure, the researcher-developed receptive Spanish vocabulary measure, the researcher-developed Spanish CAP task, and on a measure that examined the quality of their oral narratives samples (macrostructural oral narrative elements) produced during a story retell and story spontaneous task. Children in the intervention group also produced significantly lengthier mean length utterances (MLU; microstructural oral narrative elements) on the story retell task. The longitudinal effects of the intervention were examined using one-way mixed repeated ANOVAs. Results did not revealed any interaction effect favoring the intervention group, suggesting that effects faded at a 12 month follow up. ANCOVAs were also used to examine between group performance on all follow-up outcome variables while controlling for pre-test scores. Results revealed a positive impact of in the intervention on children\\u2019s MLU for their story retell samples.    \\n \\n 94 Generalized Vocabulary and Targeted Vocabulary   It was hypothesized that children in the intervention group would outperform their peers in the control group on all vocabulary measures administered at post-test and follow-up. Results showed that the vocabulary hypotheses were partially supported.  Specifically, it was found that exposure to the 12-week Spanish language SBR curriculum lead to a significant gain on generalized Spanish-language receptive vocabulary skills as measured by the Receptive One Word Picture Vocabulary Test (ROWPVT) at post-testing. This finding is consistent with the findings of studies with English-speaking families  (e.g. Arnold, Lonigan, Whitehurst, and Epstein, 1994; Dale, Crain-Thoreson, Notari-Syverson, & Cole, 1996; Fielding-Barnsley and Purdie, 2003) and the findings of two studies that examined the effect of Spanish-English SBR interventions with Latino children (e.g. Roberts, 2008; Tsybina & Eriks-Brophy, 2009). The positive impact of the Spanish-language SBR curriculum on children\\u2019s Spanish receptive vocabulary provides supportive evidence of the usefulness of incorporating a variety of parent-child interactive strategies during the SBR session. Experimental studies have found that extra-textual discussions during SBR, including defining words (e.g., Biemiller & Boote, 2006, Justice, 2002), asking children to repeat targeted words during the reading (Senechal, 1997) contributes to the acquisition of receptive vocabulary. The incorporation of cognitively demanding discussion in SBR sessions (e.g. inferential questions, making predictions, connecting the readings to children\\u2019s personal experiences) has also been found to contribute to the acquisition of vocabulary (deTemple & Snow, 2003). Additionally, repeated readings have been found to be \\n \\n 95 critical for developing children\\u2019s vocabulary (Senechal, 1997). All of these strategies were used in the SBR reading curriculum.   Although children in the intervention group demonstrated higher gains in general receptive vocabulary at post-testing, the advantage was not observed at the 12-month follow-up. Contrary to the hypothesis, children in the intervention group showed a declined on their group score at follow-up (standard score: 99.33; SD 12.81) when compared to their post-test score (standard score: 108; SD 6.91), while the control group\\u2019s follow-up score (standard score = 98.00 SD 4.64) remained about the same (standard score: 97; SD 12. 59). This non-statistical finding is consistent with Whitehurst et al.\\u2019s (1988) longitudinal study that examined the effects of a 4-week parent-delivered intervention (Dialogic Reading) on generalized expressive and receptive vocabulary, psycholinguistic abilities and MLU at post-testing and at a 9-month follow-up with a sample of middle-class English-speaking parent-child dyads. In their study, children in the intervention group obtained statistically higher scores on all measures than their peers in the control group at post-testing; however, at the 9-month follow up, the scores were no longer statistically significant (Whitehurst et al., 1988).  The non-significant finding at follow-up was unexpected and may suggest a number of possibilities. For example, when examining raw scores, it was observed that 7 out of the 9 children in the intervention group made gains from post to follow up, as their raw score increased (range of increase, 3 to 20 points). One child had a decrease of one point (post raw score: 42; follow-up raw score: 41) and another child had a decrease of 24 points (post raw score: 40; follow-up raw score: 24). Notable, the child with the \\n \\n 96 significant decrease in raw score was not enrolled in a preschool during the time of the intervention or at the 12-month follow-up. This appears to indicate that this outlier may have impacted the average group score at follow-up.  When examining the raw-scores for children in the control group, with the exception of one participant whose raw score was identical at follow-up, the rest of the children showed an increase at follow-up from post-testing (range of increase, 3-25 points). The pattern of growth for some children in both groups may imply what in the literature has been coined as the \\u201cMatthew effect.\\u201d The Matthew effect illustrates a pattern of performance in where children with larger vocabularies or better oral language skills have an easier time acquiring new words as they need less exposure to unfamiliar words (Metsala, 1999; deTemple & Snow, 2003), while children with smaller vocabularies have more difficulty acquiring new words, thus a gap forms between the two groups. It is possible that the SBR intervention was not sufficient  (e.g., length, intensity, duration) to significantly alter the vocabulary trajectory growth for those children who began the intervention with smaller receptive vocabulary knowledge.  Another possible explanation for the non-significant finding at follow-up might be due a decreased in frequency of SBR after the intervention ended. At post-testing parents from both groups reported engaging in frequent SBR as a result of the project.  However, at the 12-month follow-up, both groups reported engaging in less SBR. In fact, one parent in the intervention group reported zero engagement. As discussed in the literature review, oral language development is significantly impacted by the home literacy environment, which includes frequency of SBR at home (Senechal & LeFevre, \\n \\n 97 2002; Senechal, Lefrevre, Hudson, &Lawson, 1996). If parents in the intervention group decreased or stopped engaging in interactive SBR, this may explain the relatively minimal receptive vocabulary growth over time. Given that we did not collect qualitative information about the home literacy practices after the intervention ended, this interpretation should be considered with caution.  No statistically significant group performance at post-testing or follow-up was obtained for generalized expressive vocabulary skills in Spanish as measured by the Expressive One Word Picture Vocabulary Test (EOWPVT); however, in an absolute sense, the intervention group obtained higher scores. That there was no significant finding for expressive vocabulary was somewhat contrary to the existing body of research. The works of Whitehurst and Lonigan (1998) and Arnold, Lonigan, Whitehurst, and Epstein (1994) show that teaching English-speaking parents how to help their child become the teller of the story using interactive dialogue (Dialogic Reading intervention), significantly increased children\\u2019s general expressive skills following the intervention. The SBR curriculum used in this study differs from Dialogic Reading in that parents are provided with scripted questions and prompts to make predictions of the reading, to discuss targeted words and connect the reading to their lives. However, both methods of intervention promote the use of interactive discourse between parent and child, which the literature indicates promotes oral language development (e.g. Mol, Bus, De Jong, & Smeets, 2008). It is possible that the short intervention (12 weeks) only produced gains in general receptive vocabulary, as receptive vocabulary is relatively easier to acquire and it develops prior to expressive vocabulary. Although it should be \\n \\n 98 mentioned that the finding of other parent-child SBR interventions with English speaking low-SES and middle class families, have documented general expressive and receptive vocabulary gains with intervention that were shorter than 12 weeks (Arnold, Lonigan, Whitehurst, and Epstein, 1994; Whitehurst, Falco, Lonigan et al.,1988 and Whitehurst and Lonigan, 1998). It is also possible that the use of more cognitively complex questioning, a component of the present intervention, affected receptive vocabulary more so than expressive vocabulary.  Although it would require replication with a sample large enough to determine significance, another possible explanation for the discrepant results might be parental adherence to the intervention or fidelity. A descriptive analysis of intervention children\\u2019s performance on the vocabulary measures suggested that children whose parents used the curriculum with high fidelity (N=5) obtained higher scores as a group on the EOWPVT (Standard Score =112) than children whose parents used the curriculum with moderate fidelity (Standard Score =101.50) or low fidelity (102.33). Descriptively speaking, it appears that the intervention likely contributed to expressive vocabulary development, particularly when the intervention was implemented as recommended. Given our sample size and noting the non-significant statistical trend, it is also possible that there was not enough power to detect statistical significances if any. Another explanation could be the measure itself. It is possible that the standardized EOWPVT is not sensitive enough to detect change in a small time period or has a floor effect with this population. In their meta-analysis, the National Reading Panel (NICHD, 2000) recommended the use of researcher-developed vocabulary measures to detect gains following short-term \\n \\n 99 intervention, as they explained that these measures are more sensitive to instructional gains.  Our findings for the researcher-developed vocabulary measure supported recommendations of the National Reading Panel (2000). Results indicated that exposure to the Spanish SBR curriculum had a moderate effect on the Researcher-Developed receptive vocabulary test (ES=.37) at post-test. Children who received intervention were able to correctly identify an average of 7 out of the possible 9-targeted words (targeted receptive vocabulary). This finding suggests that when Spanish-speaking parents read to their children interactively and deliberately discuss words in the context of the books, children\\u2019s vocabulary is enhanced. As discussed earlier, the 12-week SBR curriculum used in this study incorporated a variety of strategies that have been identified as powerful techniques in interactive book reading for developing receptive and expressive vocabulary. This finding is also consistent with other studies examining the effectiveness of parent-delivered SBR interventions (e.g. Hargrave & Senechal, 2000; Roberts, 2008).  The results are more promising considering that children in the control group had access to all the curriculum books used in the intervention group (without the scaffolded vocabulary lessons) and according to control parent-report at post-testing about SBR practices, control children were incidentally exposed (e.g., the mother read the story, the word is in the story, incidental exposure) to vocabulary targeted in the curriculum. This suggests that frequent shared-book reading alone may not be sufficiently powerful enough develop low-income children\\u2019s receptive and expressive vocabulary skills. This finding is consistent with findings from experimental studies comparing the \\n \\n 100 effectiveness of read-aloud with not much parent-child dialogue and interactive shared-book reading (e.g. Roberts, Jurgens & Burchid, 2005; S\\u00e9n\\u00e9chal, 2002). For example, in one study, it was found that parent\\u2019s engagement in conversation that went beyond the book was more effective in increasing children\\u2019s oral language skills than by the simple act of frequent reading (Roberts, Jurgens & Burchid, 2005). The finding of this study supports this and extend the literature by showing that when low-SES Spanish-speaking parents use cognitive complex questioning before, during and after the reading, they successfully assist their children in acquiring new words.   Although children in the intervention group obtained higher scores on the researcher developed receptive vocabulary test at follow-up (M=8.22) than children in the control group (M=6.78), the trajectory of growth did not reach statistical significance at follow-up. It is possible that sample size may have impacted the ability to detect growth over time. It is also possible that the results may have been confounded by internal and external validity factors that were not controlled for in this study. For example, maturation effect may explain the growth observed for the control group. Their growth may also be explained by accidental or deliberate exposure to the targeted words after the follow-up. It is important to highlight that at the end of the 12-week intervention families in the control group received a copy the SBR curriculum and a brief overview on how to use it. Thus, it is possible that parents in the control group used the curriculum to expose their children to the targeted vocabulary; however, it is difficult to know, as this data was not collected, a limitation of this study.   \\n \\n 101 Concepts about Print  Children in the intervention group also demonstrated better knowledge of concepts about print in Spanish at post-test (M= 11.80, SD 2.04) than children in the control group (M= 8.60, SD, 3.09). This finding indicates that at the end of the 12-week intervention, children in the intervention group were more familiar with reading conventions than their peers in the control group. Overall, the results of this study are consistent with the results of other parent-child SBR studies (e.g., Arnold et al., 1994; Chow and McBride-Chang, 2003). Previous research has demonstrated that engagement in literacy activities can significantly improve children\\u2019s knowledge about CAP (e.g. Hammill, 2004). We expected these findings given that the curriculum prompted parents in the intervention group to discuss concepts about print during each shared-book session. For example, parents were instructed to always point and introduce the title of the book when beginning their shared-book reading session. Additionally, it is well known that interactive book reading naturally exposes children to print, but children who engage in conversations about print and how books are organized (e.g., \\u201cLet\\u2019s read the title of our book;\\u201d while pointing) are more likely to acquire more CAP skills (Justice & Ezell, 2001). Although, the SBR curriculum used in this study did not specifically focus on teaching parents to reference the print during SBR, it did instruct them to begin each SBR session by showing their child the cover of the book, read the title, followed by asking their child to look at all the pages in the book while making predictions about what they thought the books would be about. Results indicate that the curriculum contributed to children\\u2019s acquisition of CAP skills but we do not know what specific \\n \\n 102 component of the curriculum contributed to the positive outcome. It is possible that the activities at the beginning of each SBR session contributed to this finding.   Contrary to the hypothesis, at follow-up, children in the control group demonstrated a statistically significant higher growth over time on their Spanish CAP skills. We expected children in the intervention group to maintain their advantage on CAP skills at follow-up; however, results indicated that their growth was slower compared to children in the control group. Possible explanations for the higher growth observed for children in the control group include more deliberate or incidental exposure to literacy activities at home and at school after the intervention ended. It should be noted again that all children in the control group were enrolled in kindergarten at follow-up, while 7 children in the intervention group were enrolled in kindergarten, 2 were enrolled in preschool and one child was not enrolled in school. Considering that in Kindergarten children are exposed to instruction on early readings skills, it would be expected for children to develop a strong foundation in CAP skills by the end of school year. Thus, is possible that educational factors that were not accounted for in the study may have contributed to the findings. Non-statistical findings over time have also been documented in one longitudinal study (Whitehurst et al., 1999) that examined the combined (school and home) effect of Dialogic Reading intervention on low-income children\\u2019s oral language and print concept skills. The results of this study also found positive impacts of the intervention at post-testing for CAP skills, but not at follow-up.  Microstructure and Macrostructure Oral Narrative Skills This study also examined children\\u2019s performance on measures of microstructure \\n \\n 103 and macrostructure oral narrative skills. These skills are important as they assist in the transition from oral language to written language (Westby, 1991). The production of oral narratives requires the incorporation of vocabulary knowledge, syntactic and morphological knowledge at the sentence level and the ability to create a cohesive story that connects information (Paul et al., 1996). In the present study, two aspects of microstructure were examined: productivity (mean length utterance; MLU) and lexical diversity (number of different words; NDW). Macrostructure was measured by examining the quality of the narrative using the Narrative Scoring Scheme (SALT, 2012).  Under the assumption that the Spanish SBR reading curriculum would create ample opportunities for the intervention parent-child dyads to engage in complex linguistic interactions that in turn would help children produce lengthier utterances and expand their productive vocabulary, it was hypothesized that statistically significant differences would be detected between the groups on microstructure measures of productivity (MLU) and lexical diversity (NDW) for both the story retell and spontaneous story narrative tasks. The results partially supported the hypotheses. A significant group difference was found for the story retell task; participants in the intervention group produced longer utterances for the story retell task at post-test (M=5.85) and follow-up (M= 7.33) than children in the control group (post-test, M=5.16; follow-up, M=6.68). This finding is consistent with a previous study that investigated the impact of interactive parent-child shared-book reading on children\\u2019s oral language skills and mean length utterance (e.g. Whitehurst, 1995).  \\n \\n 104 Interestingly, no significant difference was observed on the story spontaneous task. One possible explanation for this finding is that the story retell task resembles the structured shared-book reading session used in the curriculum, which encouraged the child to summarize the story at the end of the reading (e.g. \\u201c\\u00bfde que se trato nuestro libro?\\u201d /what was our book about?). This demand is similar to that of the story-retell task used in this study; children were read a wordless picture book and then asked to retell the story. Thus, it appears that when children were provided with a sample of the story and then asked to retell the story, it was easier for them to produce lengthier utterances. On the other hand, the spontaneous story task required children to multi-task by requiring them to plan their story without any guidance while having to structure their oral language to tell a story.  In contrast to expectations, no differences were found among the groups in the diversity of words used in their oral narrative samples. It was hypothesized that children who received the SBR intervention would demonstrate increased oral language skill and these gains would be detected by doing a count of the different words used in their oral narrative samples. It is possible that the dosage of the intervention was not enough to increase children\\u2019s use of diverse words in their oral narratives.  Similar results were found in an experimental study examining the impact of an 8-week researcher-implemented Dialogic Reading (DR) intervention on Canadian Kindergartener\\u2019s oral narrative skills (Lever & S\\u00e9n\\u00e9chal, 2011). In this study, children who received the DR intervention obtained statistically significant higher scores on macrostructural elements (e.g. story grammar, mental states) when asked to retell a story than their peers in the \\n \\n 105 control group who received an alternative treatment (e.g. phoneme awareness program), but no group difference were found on any of the microstructural oral narrative elements assessed (e.g. MLU, number of words and ratio of number of different words).  Under the assumption that the SBR curriculum would expose children to a variety of story grammar elements and that the scripted discussions at the end of the each SBR session would help children produce a cohesive narrative (Harkins et al., 2001), it was hypothesize that children in the intervention would obtain higher scores on the quality of their narrative at post-testing and at follow-up than their control peers. The macrostructural elements measured in this study consisted of a total score for the use of story grammar elements as measured by the Narrative Scoring Scheme (NSS; Heilmann, Miller, Nockerts, & Dunaway, 2010), which assessed for the presence and quality of the following elements: introduction, character development, mental and emotional states, referencing, conflict/resolution, cohesion and conclusion. As hypothesized, the results of the ANCOVA at post-testing detected significant group differences in macrostructural oral narrative skills for both, the story retell and story spontaneous tasks. Children in the intervention group obtained higher scores for the quality of their narratives. This was expected given that exposure to a variety of books can develop children\\u2019s understanding of the story grammar. Additionally, the curriculum instructed parents to engage their child in summarizing the book at the end of each reading session, likely facilitating children\\u2019s development of story retelling. The positive effect of the Spanish SBR curriculum on macrostructrual oral narrative skills is consistent with the results of two other studies with English-speaking children, which found positive impact of their \\n \\n 106 intervention on children\\u2019s oral narrative skills (Zevenbergen, Whitehurst, and Zevenebergen, 2003; Lever & S\\u00e9n\\u00e9chal, 2011).   Contrary to expectations, at follow-up, children in the control group demonstrated significant gains over time on their oral narrative ability for the story spontaneous task. For the story-retell task, the control group also obtained higher scores, although their performance was not statistically different than children in the intervention group. This finding is difficult to explain. As mentioned earlier, a possible explanation for the gains made by children in the control group on the different outcome variables may be due to more incidental (or intentional) exposure to literacy activities at home and school. Regrettably, we were unable to control or account for the effect of school on the outcome variables (e.g., a nesting effect). Also, per parent report, at-follow up, all parents in  control parents were continuing to engage in SBR, while not all parents in the intervention group reported engaging in SBR. If the intervention children experienced less opportunities for exposure to story grammar, then a slower rate of growth in oral narrative development would be expected. Currently, few research studies have examined the impact of SBR interventions on children\\u2019s oral language development (Lever & S\\u00e9n\\u00e9chal, 2011; Zevenbergen, Whitehurst, and Zevenebergen, 2003; S\\u00e9n\\u00e9chal, Pagan, Lever, and Ouellette, 2008) and results have been mixed. To the knowledge of this writer, this is the first study examining the long-term effects of a Spanish parent-delivered SBR intervention on Spanish-speaking children\\u2019s oral narrative. Replication studies are needed with a larger sample size to understand the \\n \\n 107 potential long-lasting impact of a SBR intervention on children\\u2019s oral narrative development.  Given the observed gains for children in the control group, a possible confounding variable not measured or controlled for in this study is the impact of schooling. All children in the control group were enrolled in kindergarten at follow-up, indicating that they had received two years of instruction. Therefore, at follow-up, the groups appeared to have been different in terms of exposure to and nature of instruction and this possibly impacted the results on the Spanish CAP task and performance on the narrative scoring scheme for the oral narrative tasks.  Overall Findings and Implications  Although we were unable to detect long-term sustained effects of the intervention on the outcome variables, the pilot study makes a contribution to the literature by showing that teaching Low-SES Spanish-speaking parents how to use a 12-week SBR curriculum to create enriching discussions about words and stories during their SBR sessions can positively impact children\\u2019s general receptive vocabulary and targeted vocabulary development, their knowledge about CAP and their oral narrative skills at short-term. The long-lasting effects of the intervention were only observed for one outcome variable, children\\u2019s MLU for their story retell samples. This finding is promising, as it indicates that this intervention can have a long-lasting effect in maintaining children\\u2019s productive language; however, this study would need to be replicated. On the other hand, the no-statistical findings at follow-up for the other outcome variables that were positively impacted at post-testing (standardized \\n \\n 108 receptive/expressive vocabulary, researcher-developed receptive vocabulary, narrative development), suggests that the intervention may not have be sufficient or intense enough to sustain children\\u2019s general vocabulary growth and oral narrative development. Although disappointing, a lack of long-term sustainability is not uncommon. Other well-researched studies involving early language and literacy programs have shown diminished effects over time (e.g., Barnett & Hustedt, 2005). In the present study, it appears the after the intervention ended, not all parents in the intervention group continued to engage in frequent SBR sessions (e.g., return to baseline conditions) which might explain the slow growth in children\\u2019s general vocabulary gains and oral narrative skills.  One implication of the findings of this study is that the intervention may not have been sufficiently robust to change the home literacy practices after the intervention ended. Alternatively, it is possible that not enough time was spent with parents teaching the principles underlying the intervention (e.g., repeated review, scaffolding) so that they could be understood and internalized to support generalization beyond the intervention. It is also possible that the parents perceived the intervention as too \\u201cscripted\\u201d and inconsistent with their personal/cultural teaching beliefs therefore inappropriate beyond their participation in the intervention. This suggests the need for more research to understand how much \\u201cdosage\\u201d is needed when working with low-SES Spanish-speaking families. Results of a community-based SBR intervention with a sample of low-income families, including Latinos families (N=67), showed that preschool children in the study benefited the most from an intensified 18-week shared-book reading \\n \\n 109 intervention (Cronan et al., 1996).  However, the long-term effects of this intervention were not assessed. When working with Low-SES Latino families, higher dosage of intervention may be needed to change parents\\u2019 literacy practices and/or beliefs that in turn may support sustainability of gains made at post-testing.  Even when varying levels of treatment implementation were observed among the intervention parents, the intervention appeared to have positively affected children\\u2019s vocabulary, CAP and microstructural and macrostructural narrative elements at post-testing. This suggests that a home-based shared-book reading curriculum with scripted discussion questions and prompts may be useful in developing children\\u2019s Spanish-speaking foundational language skills at short-term. Given that no long-lasting effects were observed on all outcome variables, it is also possible that the low adherence of the other parents could have mitigated the possible long-lasting effects of the intervention. Considering this possible explanation, it is imperative that future studies examine the most effective method for training parents in using SBR interventions with fidelity. Current best practices in early childhood development recommend the use of coaching for teacher development when implementing evidenced-based intervention (Domitrovich et al., 2008). This a potential strategy that should be examined in future SBR studies with Spanish-speaking families.  Limitations The results of this study should be interpreted considering its limitations. First of all, the sample size of this study was small (N =20 at pre-post and N =18 at follow up), which limited statistical power. Small sample sizes can increase the chances of accepting \\n \\n 110 a false null hypothesis (Type II errors) due to limited power of the statistical analysis.  Second, although this study utilized an experimental pre-post-test control group design that included random selection of participants, participants were recruited from a targeted area in South Central, Texas at a Catholic church serving Spanish-speaking Latino families, thus making it a convenience sample. It possible that the families recruited showed similarities in their values, beliefs and home literacy behaviors that may not represent a diverse Latino population. It is possible that the current findings may not be generalizable to Latino families in urban areas, or of different cultural origin, and/or of higher economic status. Third, the Researcher-Developed instruments used in this study had a number of limitations. Although the curriculum covered 52 words, only 8 receptive and 9 expresses targeted words were measured due to modification to the intervention and low reliability of the items. Reliability analysis for the Researcher-developed Receptive Vocabulary Test the 12 items resulted in low alpha of .46 for pre-test scores. The alpha improved to .60 at pre-tests when 4 test items were removed improved. The initial reliability of the Researcher-developed Expressive Vocabulary Test had a low reliability even when items were removed and therefore had to be removed from the analysis. A replication study should consider increasing the number of items in the vocabulary measures and piloting them to ensure consistency in reliability. Additionally, a standardized CAP task with more consistent psychometrics properties should be considered. The initial reliability analysis for the Researcher-developed CAP task in Spanish with the 15 items resulted in a modest alpha (.67) for pre-test scores and improved slightly .71 after 1 item was \\n \\n 111 eliminated; however, the reliability decreased at post-test and follow-up.  Fourth, one threat to the internal validity of this study that need to be considered. Maturation effects, meaning natural growth over time in participating children\\u2019s oral language and emergent literacy skills may have affected the results of the study. Although maturation effects could impact both groups, it is possible that the control group was inherently different than the intervention group and the maturation effect masked the effects of the intervention.  Fifth, adherence to the intervention was not closely controlled for during the intervention period and thus, it is impossible to truly know how much intervention each child receive. The results of the fidelity of implementation checklist indicate that the intervention parents were over-reporting their adherence to the curriculum, as the results of fidelity analysis of their SBR audio-recordings indicated that only half of the participants adhered to the intervention. Future studies examining parent-delivered SBR intervention need to explore the impact of variations of dosage to intervention.  Lastly, given that the control group received a copy of the SBR curriculum at the end of the intervention period, they were not truly a control group when assessed at follow-up. The investigator was unable to determine it parents in the control group indeed used the intervention. Future replication studies need to examine the effects the curriculum with a true control group.   Conclusion and Future Directions This pilot study contributes to the existing literature gap on SBR intervention for Spanish-speaking Latino families. The findings of this study provides evidence of the \\n \\n 112 benefits of implementing a SBR intervention in a child\\u2019s primary or native language and supports the findings of the two other studies that implemented a combined Spanish and English SBR intervention with Latino families (Roberts, 2008; Tsybina & Eriks-Brophy, 2009). This study differs from that of Roberts (2008) and Tsybina & Eriks-Brophy (2009) in that this intervention exclusively examined the impact of a parent-delivered SBR curriculum, while the other studies examined the combined effect (school +home and researcher-implemented + parent) of a bilingual (Spanish-English) Dialogic Intervention on children\\u2019s oral language skills.  The results of this study extends the literature by demonstrating that a relatively short SBR curriculum can produce positive outcomes for Spanish-speaking children whose parents presented with low levels of education and low socio-economic status. The benefits of SBR interventions in Spanish on children\\u2019s English need to continue to be examined, considering that research from cross-linguistic research indicate that numerous oral language skills (e.g. phonemic awareness, vocabulary) and literacy skills (e.g. decoding) developed in a child\\u2019s primarily language (e.g., Spanish) can transfer to their second language (e.g. Lindsey, Manis, & Bailey, 2003; Nakamoto, Lindsey & Manis, 2008; Proctor et al., 2006; Snow et al., 1998). These findings highlight the potential benefit of developing Latino children\\u2018s oral language skills in their primary language. By providing Spanish-speaking parents with the tools necessary to enhance their children\\u2019s oral language and emergent literacy skills we can indirectly contribute the transfer of oral language skills to English. \\n \\n 113 Given the sample size of this study and considering its limitations, the results need to be replicated with a larger sample of Spanish-speaking parent-child dyads. It is imperative that future studies continue to examine the effects of parent-delivered shared-book reading interventions with the Latino population using longitudinal methods. As noted in the literature review, young Latino children are considered an at-risk group and are likely to enter school lagging behind their White peers on important language and emergent literacy skills. Future studies should investigate what are the most effective ways (e.g. intensity of parent training) for providing training for low-income Spanish speaking parents in order to increase fidelity of treatment implementation. Future studies should also consider implementing a parent-coaching method to determine if this technique can change parent\\u2019s home literacy practice over time. In the present pilot study, it appears that some intervention parents did not continue to engage in frequent SBR reading practices.  Future studies also need to look at: (1) parental perceptions of their role in literacy development, (2) maternal education and its relationship to literacy engagement, (3) parental reading beliefs and (4) child interest/motivation following the intervention. These are all important elements in the home literacy environment that need to be better understand in order to be able to develop SBR interventions that can be sustained over time.    \\n \\n 114 REFERENCES Arnold, D.

Each narrative will be evaluated on 7 characteristics (introduction, character development, mental states, referencing, conflict resolution, cohesion and conclusion) using a 0-5 point scale.  It is of most importance that we establish reliability between the raters. For this reason, that research assistant (s) and the primary investigator will complete a training reliability test before beginning to score.   Step 1: Meet with principal investigator  5. Review training goals and expectations a. Go over the training manual and scoring rubric  Step 2: Training provided by the SALT Company  1. Become familiarized with the SALT website (http://www.saltsoftware.com/). 2. Create a user account http://www.saltsoftware.com/onlinetraining/login-form 3.

This conclusion\\nderives primarily from studies showing how preschoolers\\u2019 literacy and languagecorrespond with later acquisition of reading and spelling in school (Schatschneider,Fletcher, Francis, Carlson, & Foorman, 2004 ). Moreover, research demonstrated\\nthat preschool- or kindergarten-based interventions promoting early literacy or\\nlanguage contributed to later reading and spelling acquisition as well as to later\\nlanguage development in school (Vellutino & Scanlon, 2001 ).\\nThe goal of this study was to assess the effects of intervention programs aiming\\nto improve the quality of joint parent\\u2013child activities, and the differential effects ofimproved joint activities on their kindergarten-age children\\u2019s early literacy andlanguage. Parents, including mostly mothers, were coached in performing one ofthree joint activities with their children: writing, reading storybooks, or \\ufb01nevisuomotor skill activities. Then, they engaged their children in the coached joint\\nactivities 3 times per week, for 7 weeks. Maternal writing mediation and maternal\\nstorybook reading were measured before and after intervention to assess theinterventions\\u2019 effects on maternal performance. Children were compared on gains inalphabetic skills and linguistic competencies due to improvement in these jointactivities.\\nLow-SES mothers: signi\\ufb01cant target for enhancement\\nFamilies deriving from low socioeconomic strata were targeted because children\\ngrowing up in poverty lag behind their counterparts in early literacy and language(e.g., Dickinson & Snow, 1987 ), as well as reading and spelling acquisition and\\nlanguage growth in school (Duncan & Seymour, 2000 ; Korat & Levin, 2001 ).\\nIntervention studies in low-SES preschools or kindergartens have often been carriedout by research assistants. Our study targeted parents, who are the \\ufb01rst teachers oftheir children (Britto, Brooks-Gunn, & Grif\\ufb01n, 2006 ). Parents hold primary\\nresponsibility for their children\\u2019s wellbeing and development, and are motivated to\\npromote their children\\u2019s present and future welfare. Helping parents realize that\\nthey are capable of assisting their child to prepare for schooling, and speci\\ufb01callycoaching parents in guiding their children\\u2019s learning, may broaden their conceptionof parental roles and parenting styles. Encouraging low-SES parents to take on therole of guiding their children\\u2019s learning is an ambitious endeavor because of theirrelatively limited educational resources and their competing duties and stressors.\\nStorybook reading and joint writing\\nChildren and parents can share a variety of activities that potentially enhance\\nlanguage and literacy: storybook reading, joint writing, recognizing environmentalprint, playing with letters, rhyming games, and watching educational TV programs.Nevertheless, most studies in this domain have focused on joint storybook reading.Reviews of decades of research on the relations between amount of storybook reading218 I. Levin, D. Aram\\n123\\nand the development of language and literacy led to the conclusion that this\\nrelationship is reliable (Bus, van IJzendoorn, & Pellegrini, 1995 ; Scarborough &\\nDobrich, 1994 ). Yet, a large amount of the variance in children\\u2019s achievements\\nremains unexplained. Among the many possible explanatory factors, the contribution\\nof other parent\\u2013child joint activities to children\\u2019s language and literacy meritexploration.\\nAram and Levin ( 2002 ) contrasted two major types of joint parent\\u2013child\\nactivities, storybook reading and parental mediation of writing, and studied theircontribution to early literacy and language in preschoolers. They found that thefrequency of joint storybook reading explained signi\\ufb01cant variance in children\\u2019sverbal abilities (per teacher rankings) after partialling out home literacy and\\nmaternal mediation in joint writing. Maternal mediation of writing consistently\\nexplained substantial variance in children\\u2019s alphabetic skills (i.e., invented spelling,word writing and recognition, and phonological awareness), after partialling outhome literacy and storybook reading. Hood, Conlon, and Andrews ( 2008 ) studied\\nhow parental teaching of print to kindergartners (i.e., writing names and identifyingletters/words) on the one hand and storybook reading on the other were connected tochildren\\u2019s literacy. Parental teaching of print was independently related to letter-word identi\\ufb01cation scores in kindergarten and to reading and spelling in grades 1\\nand 2, whereas storybook reading was independently related to vocabulary in grade\\n1. These \\ufb01ndings extended those obtained by Se \\u00b4ne\\u00b4chal and LeFevre ( 2002 ). Taken\\ntogether, the studies indicate that storybook reading is connected to linguisticcompetencies, mainly to vocabulary, whereas joint writing and other print-orientedactivities are connected to alphabetic skills.\\nStorybook reading and writing mediation: intervention programs in preschools\\nAram and Biron ( 2004 ) demonstrated that two different programs of joint activities\\nfor an adult with small groups of children enhanced different child achievements inpreschools serving low-SES populations. In the storybook reading program, trainedgraduate students read stories interactively, and in the writing program, theymediated writing. Pretest\\u2013posttest comparisons showed that children in the writingprogram surpassed children in the reading program on invented spelling, alliteration,rhyming, and orthographic awareness. In contrast with expectations, the children inthe reading program did not outperform the writing group on vocabulary, listening\\ncomprehension, or concepts of print, but they did outscore the control group.\\nIntervention programs\\u2019 effects on maternal writing mediation and interactive\\nstorybook reading\\nNo study thus far has examined improvement of parental mediation of writing due\\nto intervention. However, several studies have analyzed the changes that occurred inmother\\u2013child verbal interactivity during storybook reading following interventions.\\nIn these studies, trained mothers were asked to read storybooks interactively several\\ntimes a week for 4\\u201312 weeks (across studies). Reading sessions at pretest andposttest(s) were videotaped or audiotaped, and the frequencies of maternal use ofJoint activities and literacy 219\\n123\\nstrategies supporting or reducing dialogues were assessed. Results showed that, in\\ngeneral, strategies supporting dialogues increased from pretest to the immediateposttest (Blom-Hoffman, O\\u2019Neil-Pirozzi, Volpe, Cutting, & Bissinger, 2006 ;\\nBriesch, Chafouleas, Lebel, & Blom-Hoffman, 2008 ; Crain-Thoreson & Dale,\\n1999 ; Huebner, 2000 ; Huebner & Meltzoff, 2005 ; Whitehurst et al., 1988 ), whereas\\nstrategies reducing dialogues decreased (Crain-Thoreson & Dale, 1999 ; Huebner,\\n2000 ; Huebner & Meltzoff, 2005 ). At the delayed posttest (2.5\\u20136.0 months later\\nacross studies), the frequency of dialogic strategies slightly decreased but often didnot differ from its heightened level at the immediate posttest (Blom-Hoffman et al.,2006 ; Briesch et al., 2008 ; Huebner & Meltzoff, 2005 ).\\nEnhanced writing mediation and interactive storybook reading: effects on\\nearly literacy\\nRemember that no study thus far has investigated improvement of parental\\nmediation of writing due to intervention. Interactive reading was found to enhancechildren\\u2019s vocabulary more than regular reading, in a meta-analysis (Mol, Bus, deJong, & Smeets, 2008 ). However, the contribution of interactive versus regular\\nreading decreased with the child\\u2019s age, appearing as strong for 2\\u20133 year olds\\n(d=0.50), and as negligible for 4\\u20135 year olds ( d=0.14). The authors explained\\nthat older children do not depend on parental interactive reading, because they arebetter able to process the text, to trace their own limitations in story comprehension,and to ask questions when in need of clari\\ufb01cation. Further, the contribution ofinteractive reading to children\\u2019s vocabulary emerged as strong for children recruitedfrom middle to high SES ( d=0.53), but not from low SES ( d=0.13). Mol and her\\ncolleagues suggested that mothers with low education may not be able to carry outinteractive reading at the required level, or that their children may \\ufb01nd it dif\\ufb01cult to\\nrespond to open-ended questions or to questions that require inferencing.\\nThe limited value of interactive reading to kindergartners from poor families is\\ndisappointing, because these children are in special need of linguistic enrichment asa major asset preparing them for the subsequent \\ufb01rst grade of school (van Kleeck,2008 ). Our study used intervention programs for low-SES mothers of kindergart-\\nners, aiming to improve interactive reading as well as writing mediation and,thereby promoting children\\u2019s language and literacy.\\nGuiding mothers in mediated learning: transfer across skills\\nEf\\ufb01cient maternal mediation includes scaffolding at a challenging but not frustrating\\nlevel, sensitivity to the child\\u2019s competence and perspective, encouragement ofactive participation on the part of the child, and assistance in alerting the child tohis/her metacognitive processes (Feuerstein, 1998 ; Vygotsky, 1978 ). We examined\\nwhether mediation of writing or interactive reading is a speci\\ufb01c skill that can betaught only by clarifying the speci\\ufb01c strategies used for these activities, or whether\\nmothers exposed to the general principles of mediated learning and who have been\\ntrained to mediate in one domain can generalize these skills to mediate learning inanother domain. This kind of transfer, conceptualized as a high-road transfer,220 I. Levin, D. Aram\\n123\\nrequires learning of abstract principles and applying them mindfully to a new\\ncontext (Salomon & Perkins, 1989 ).\\nTransfer of training in writing mediation to caregivers\\u2019 other activities has never\\nbeen studied before. Transfer of training of parental interactive storybook reading\\nhas rarely been examined (Dale, Crain-Thoreson, Notari-Syverson, & Cole, 1996 ).\\nMothers of 3\\u20136 year olds with language delays were trained to enhance theirchildren\\u2019s linguistic functioning in two separate training programs. One programtrained a group of mothers to read picture books interactively, and the other groupwas trained to hold interactive conversations while playing with toys. Resultsshowed that the training affected mother\\u2013child interactions in the trained context:Mothers trained to read interactively increased their frequency of interactive\\nreading, whereas mothers trained in conversations during toy play increased their\\nfrequency of verbal interactions during toy play. Notably, no transfer emerged fromone activity to the other.\\nIn the current study, participating mothers were divided into four groups:\\nstorybook reading mediation, writing mediation, visuomotor mediation, and acontrol group (no mediation). The three mediation groups were instructed inmediated learning principles, applied thereafter to only one of the three differentdyadic parent\\u2013child activities. In the reading group, mothers were guided on how to\\npromote their children\\u2019s linguistic competencies through interactive reading of\\nstorybooks. In the writing group, mothers received instruction in how to promotetheir children\\u2019s early literacy skills through writing words and learning alphabeticskills. In the visuomotor skills group, mothers received guidance in how to enhancetheir children\\u2019s \\ufb01ne visuomotor skills through drawing, painting, cutting, gluing,and so forth.\\nThe joint activity promoting visuomotor skills was chosen for a control because\\nthese skills are related to some extent to school readiness, which is important for our\\ncohort (Johnson, Gallagher, Cook, & Wong, 1995 ). Moreover, promoting these\\nskills in kindergartners or \\ufb01rst-grade beginners was found to contribute to earlyschooling (Ratzon, Efraim, & Bart, 2007 ). By using this group, we could derive\\nstronger conclusions concerning the transfer of mediation skills from one jointactivity to another.\\nMajor questions of the current study\\n(1a) To what extent does training of low-SES mothers to read interactively with\\ntheir 5\\u20136 year olds effectively increase interactive reading, as measured atimmediate and delayed posttests?\\n(1b) To what extent does training of such mothers to mediate writing effectively\\nincrease level of writing mediation, as measured at immediate and delayedposttests?\\n(2a) To what extent does training in mediated learning practices, as applied to\\ninteractive storybook reading or to visuomotor skill activities, transfer to joint\\nwriting?\\n(2b) To what extent does training in mediated learning practices, as applied to\\njoint writing or to visuomotor skill activities, transfer to interactive reading?Joint activities and literacy 221\\n123\\n(3a) Does improved interactive reading in the reading group relative to the other\\ngroups (measured at posttest) predict children\\u2019s progress on linguisticcompetencies?\\n(3b) Does improved writing mediation in the writing group relative to the other\\ngroups (measured at posttest) predict children\\u2019s progress on alphabetic skills?\\nMethod\\nParticipantsParticipants were 124 mother\\u2013child dyads recruited from low-SES neighborhoods in\\nthe Tel Aviv metropolitan area. Seven additional dyads were excluded from analyses\\nbecause the videotape of either their joint reading or joint writing in the posttest wasincomprehensible or inaccessible. This attrition rate (7/131) is considered low. Bothmothers and fathers were invited to participate, but 119 mothers and 5 fathersparticipated in the study. Hence, we refer to the caregivers as mothers.\\nMean age of the 124 children (50 boys, 74 girls) at pretest was 5;4 years;months\\n(SD =0.35). Mothers\\u2019 and fathers\\u2019 mean ages were 33;7 (SD =5;7) and 36;7\\n(SD =5;7), respectively. Maternal education, measured on a 5-point scale, ranged\\nfrom not \\ufb01nishing high school (9% of mothers, 24% of fathers) to graduating from\\ncollege/university (11% of mothers, 6% of fathers). This education level is low byIsraeli standards, where 43% of the population graduates from college or university(the Israel Central Bureau of Statistics, 2006 ). The four groups of dyads (reading,\\nwriting, visuomotor, and control) did not differ statistically from each other on anydemographic parameter.\\nThe three intervention programs and the control group\\nIn the reading group, mothers were guided on how to promote their children\\u2019s\\nlinguistic competencies through interactive reading of storybooks. In the writingmediation group, mothers received instruction in how to promote their children\\u2019searly literacy skills through scaffolding them in alphabetic skills, including writingwords. In the visuomotor skills mediation group, mothers received guidance in howto enhance their children\\u2019s \\ufb01ne visuo-motor skills through scaffolding them inprocesses of drawing, painting, cutting, gluing, following lines, coloring, etc.\\nThereafter, the mothers applied what they learned to their children. The mothers in\\nthe control group were not provided with the entire program but the initialworkshops were supplied to those who wished, after the study ended.\\nInitial workshopEach program started with a workshop attended by 15\\u201320 mothers. To recruit a\\nsample of about 30 mothers per program, each workshop was repeated twice, in 2\\nconsecutive weeks, by the authors and two assistants.222 I. Levin, D. Aram\\n123\\nThe three workshops shared the same structure and referred to the following eight\\nissues in \\ufb01xed order: (1) First we discussed the role of school readiness and maternalcontribution in this arena. (2) Next we presented the principles underlying high\\nquality mediation (e.g., the importance of dialogue; of maternal sensitivity to the\\nchild\\u2019s perspective, attention span, and zone of proximal development; of helping thechild become aware of metacognitive processes; of indicating to the child his/herprogress in solving the problem). Up to this point, the three workshops were the same.From here on, the three shared the same structure but different activity contents. (3)We next discussed the development and signi\\ufb01cance of success in schooling for thespeci\\ufb01c target domain. In the reading mediation group, the domain was vocabularyand reading comprehension; in the writing group it was alphabetic skills and writing;\\nand in the visuo-motor group it was \\ufb01ne visuo-motor skills. (4) The mothers were\\nnow divided into small groups to discuss their children\\u2019s performance, home practice,and maternal mediation in the target domain. (5) A 10-min \\ufb01lm screening thenintroduced mothers to short mediation scenes illustrating principles of high-qualitymediation speci\\ufb01c to the target domain. (6) We next speci\\ufb01ed mothers\\u2019 role in theprogram: to engage their child three times per week, for 7 weeks, in activitiesdesigned by the researchers. We informed them that a tutor would meet them weeklyin their home; discuss the child\\u2019s products, the progress made, and the dif\\ufb01culties\\nencountered; and provide the tasks for the coming week. (7) We then displayed the\\nmaterials for use during the 7 weeks of intervention. We explained that motherswould receive these materials during home visits and that they would remain theirown property. (8) Mothers received materials and tasks for the \\ufb01rst week, along withguidance on how to apply them in interacting with their child.\\nJoint home activities\\nThe joint mother\\u2013child activities took place three times per week. In the interactive\\nreading group, the mother read a new storybook to the child each week,encountering each book three times (over 1 week) and asking parallel sets ofquestions across books. Printed stickers pasted on different pages provided thequestions to be asked the child before, during, or after book reading. Mothers wereguided to use the questions sensitively, by adjusting the questions to the child\\u2019sneeds. Open-ended questions focusing on text comprehension or on word meaningwere frequent. A few questions referred to print or to story grammar.\\nIn the writing training group, each week the dyad jointly wrote lists of words and\\nplayed a new game using novel magnetic cards from a commercial kit. Materialsincluded tasks pertaining to spelling words (e.g., writing words that begin with aspeci\\ufb01c sound; writing a list of peers) as well as a kit that included boards of lettersand small boxes with magnetic cards of letters and pictures for games practicingletter knowledge, phonological awareness, word spelling, and word recognition(Rosenberg, 2004 ). Each week a small box with a new game was supplied and\\napplied in that week. For instance, one game focused on pairing pictures whose\\nlabels started or ended with the same phoneme or letter.\\nIn the visuomotor skills group, each week\\u2019s activity involved playing with one\\ntype of game followed by drawing. Mothers were taught how to enhance theirJoint activities and literacy 223\\n123\\nchildren\\u2019s \\ufb01ne visuomotor skills through scaffolding them in processes of drawing,\\npainting, cutting, gluing, following lines, coloring, etc. This group\\u2019s materialsincluded seven booklets or boxes with educational games relevant to \\ufb01ne motor\\nskills, such as mazes, coloring shapes, and cutting and gluing models.\\nActivities for each session were planned to last for approximately 30 min in the\\ndifferent groups. The actual duration of mother\\u2013child interaction per session wasdetermined by the dyadic activity, and was not recorded.\\nHome visitsA graduate trained student visited the mother and the child at home each week over\\nthe 7 weeks, for about half an hour. The goals of visits were to summarize the\\ntraining experiences of the last week, collect the last week\\u2019s products, introduce thetasks for the coming week, promote maternal level of training, and solve emergingproblems. The tutors then devoted about 5 min to illustrating how to work with thechild and observed the mother guiding the dyadic interaction for another 5 min.\\nThe tutors also con\\ufb01rmed and documented extent of implementation\\u2014whether\\nall tasks were completed during the past three weekly sessions. Almost all mothersreported that all sessions were completed and that the tasks were engaging and\\nproductive. The tutors checked maternal reports by discussing the tasks and\\nobserving children\\u2019s products (e.g., written lists, completed mazes).\\nAssessments of joint interaction and child literacyData were collected in three domains\\u2014interactive reading, mediation of writing,\\nand child literacy (alphabetic skills and linguistic competencies)\\u2014at three timepoints: pretest, immediate posttest, and delayed posttest.\\nMother\\u2013child reading interaction\\nThree books were used for assessment, one per time point, drawn from a Dutch\\nseries translated into Hebrew (Velthuijs, 2000 ). These books were chosen because\\nthey were age-appropriate and well matched to each other (22 pages each, sharingauthor, illustrator, protagonists, etc.). These books included no stickers, so thedialogues between the mother and the child were self-initiated.\\nThe interactions were videotaped, and the dyadic dialogues were transcribed and\\nwere coded for two measures: category and maternal behavior. Dialogues werede\\ufb01ned as questions or comments made by one party that received either a verbal orphysical reply (e.g., pointing with a \\ufb01nger) from the other party. Only a fewdialogues were excluded from analysis because they pertained to issues irrelevant tothe targeted dyadic storybook reading activity (e.g., child answers the phone: \\u2018\\u2018Whois this? We\\u2019re in a meeting \\u2026.\\u2019\\u2019 Mother: \\u2018\\u2018Edva, hang up the phone, okay?\\u2019\\u2019).\\nDialogue category To code each dialogue for category, coders were trained to\\nassess whether the dyads\\u2019 questions or comments were classi\\ufb01ed as: (a) 1 of 6categories relating to the book\\u2019s story or illustrations (recall, completion, illustration,224 I. Levin, D. Aram\\n123\\nwh questions, word meaning, or distancing; see Huebner & MeltZoff, 2005 ;\\nWhitehurst et al., 1988 ); (b) 1 of 4 categories relating to print or alphabetic skills\\n(counting words/letters, naming or sounding letters, isolating sounds or rhyming, or\\nprint recognition); or (c) 1 of 6 categories relating to story grammar (summary,\\ncharacters, protagonist, problem, solution, or lesson). Descriptions of the 16categories and examples taken from mother\\u2013child dialogues appear in \\u2018\\u2018 Appendix A \\u2019\\u2019.\\nEach dialogue was coded as one category only. When a dialogue could be coded\\nas more than one category, coding was determined by a pre-\\ufb01xed criterion. Forinstance, a \\u2018\\u2018who question\\u2019\\u2019 about a story character was coded as a \\u2018\\u2018wh question\\u2019\\u2019 ifit appeared throughout the book reading, but was coded as a \\u2018\\u2018character\\u2019\\u2019 if itappeared after reading the story as part of discussing the story grammar.\\nEnhancing dialogues Each dialogue was also scored for its inclusion of each of\\nfour maternal behaviors: scaffolding, elaboration, praise, and correction. A dialoguethat included each of these maternal behaviors per book reading was scored 1(behavior present) or 0 (behavior absent), and the four total scores were transformedinto Zscores. The mean Zscores served as the number of enhancing dialogues .\\nDescriptions and examples of maternal scaffolding, elaboration, praise, andcorrection appear in \\u2018\\u2018 Appendix B \\u2019\\u2019.\\nCoders Two graduate students shared the coding of 381 reading-interaction\\nprotocols (127 children in three phases: pretest, immediate posttest, and delayedposttest). They were blind to any information concerning the dyad. Following a few\\ntraining sessions for learning to use the key, 36 protocols (from the four groups and\\nthe three phases) were chosen randomly to measure coding reliability. Reliabilitieswere measured by correlations between the scores given independently by the twocoders and by t-tests between their mean scores. Correlations were computed\\nbetween coders on number of mother- and child-initiated dialogues per reading.Correlations were also computed between coders on number of dialogues withscaffolds, elaborations, praise, or corrections. Finally, correlations were computedfor dialogues on story and illustrations, print, or story grammar. All correlations\\nbetween coders\\u2019 scores were highly signi\\ufb01cant, with a mean correlation of\\nM=0.96, and a range of 0.90\\u20131.00. All t-tests between coders\\u2019 scores on\\nindividual protocols were non-signi\\ufb01cant.\\nMaternal writing mediation\\nVideotapes of mothers guiding their children in a writing task served as a basis for\\nmeasuring the quality of maternal writing mediation. The mother and child were\\npresented with four stimuli cards, each of which displayed drawings of two objects,\\nalong with four blank cards. The child was asked to write the names of each pair ofillustrated objects on a separate blank card. Altogether, the four word pairscontained most of the Hebrew alphabet. Different words, generally matched inletters and syllabic structures, were written in the pretest, in the immediate posttest,and in the delayed posttest. The mother was asked to help her child as she deemedJoint activities and literacy 225\\n123\\n\\ufb01t, and no further instructions were given. Each session was videotaped, transcribed,\\nand coded according to two coding keys: grapho -phonemic andprinting mediation.\\nGrapho-phonemic mediation This ordinal scale re\\ufb02ected how the mother guided\\nher child to achieve the most complete and independent mental process possible forsegmenting a word into its sounds and orally retrieving the required letter name foreach sound, when attempting to represent that word in writing (Aram & Levin,\\n2001 ,2002 ). Mediation of each letter received a separate score because mothers\\nused different strategies for different letters in the same word. The 10-point ordinalscale used appears in the upper part of \\u2018\\u2018 Appendix C \\u2019\\u2019. The average across all the\\nletters for the eight words on this ordinal scale served as the grapho -phonemic\\nmediation score. Cronbach alpha reliabilities on pretest, immediate posttest, anddelayed posttest, respectively, were: a=0.97, 0.95, and 0.96.\\nPrinting mediation This scale re\\ufb02ected how the mother encouraged and guided\\nher child to achieve the most independent process possible for graphicallyproducing the written letter. The printed production of each letter received aseparate score along the 9-point ordinal scale that appears in the lower part of\\u2018\\u2018Appendix C \\u2019\\u2019. The average score across letters for the eight words served as the\\nprinting mediation score. Cronbach alpha reliabilities on pretest, immediate\\nposttest, and delayed posttest, respectively, were: a=0.96, 0.92, and 0.96.\\nCoding was carried out by four independent graduate students. Interjudge\\nreliability was measured on 170 letters in the pretest, 165 in the immediate posttest,\\nand 145 in the delayed posttest, retrieved from randomly selected protocols. Mean\\npercentage of agreement on grapho -phonemic mediation was 80% and on printing\\nmediation was 92%.\\nChildren\\u2019s performanceChildren were tested individually in their kindergartens on 11 tasks: 6 alphabetic\\nskills and 5 linguistic competencies.\\nAlphabetic skills The six tasks measuring alphabetic skills were used in previous\\nstudies.\\nNaming letters Children received a set of cards presenting all 27 Hebrew letters\\nand 5 pictures of objects, and were asked to name them. Presentation was in ascrambled order that changed across children. Responses to the \\ufb01rst three lettersreceived corrective feedback. The score for letter naming was the percentage ofletters named correctly (e.g., Treiman, Levin, & Kessler, 2007 ). Cronbach alpha\\nreliabilities on pretest, immediate posttest, and delayed posttest, respectively, were:\\na=0.95, 0.92, and 0.91.\\nSounding letters The same 32-card set, presented in a scrambled order, was used\\nto ask children to provide the sound that each letter stands for. Responses to the \\ufb01rst\\nthree letters received corrective feedback, with the required phoneme. The score for\\nsounding letters was the percentage of letters represented with correct phonemic226 I. Levin, D. Aram\\n123\\nsounds (see Levin, Shatil-Carmon, & Asif-Rave, 2005 ). Cronbach alpha reliabilities\\non the three phases respectively were: a=0.95, 0.96, and 0.96.\\nIsolating initial sounds in words Children listened to 16 spoken words with a CVC\\nstructure and were asked to provide the initial phoneme. These 16 phonemescomprise all the consonantal sounds acceptable in the initial position in Hebrewwords. Words were presented in two sequences, almost equally balanced across\\nchildren: from top to bottom or vice versa. Responses to the \\ufb01rst three words\\nreceived corrective feedback (Share & Blum, 2005 ). Cronbach alpha reliabilities on\\nthe three phases respectively were: a=0.96, 0.95, and 0.95.\\nReporting words\\u2019 initial letter names Children listened to a different set of 16\\nspoken words with a CVC structure and were asked to report the initial letter name.\\nWords were presented in two sequences, almost equally balanced across children:from top to bottom, or vice versa. Responses to the \\ufb01rst three words receivedcorrective feedback. The score was the percentage of initial letters correctly namedor named by homophonous letters (e.g., the letter kafinstead of the correct letter kuf\\nfor the word kir[wall]), because children of this age range are unable to tell which\\nof two homophonous letters is correct (see Levin, 2007 ). Cronbach alpha\\nreliabilities on the three phases respectively were: a=0.92, 0.86, and 0.88.\\nWord recognition Children received a pair of cards placed side by side on the table,\\neach displaying a drawing. Then the children were handed two cards consecutively,each displaying a printed word and were asked to match each printed word with its\\ndrawing. Children received three different sets of word pairs, one set at each of three\\ntesting phases. No corrective feedback was supplied. The score was the percentage ofword-drawing pairs matched correctly (see Aram & Levin, 2002 ). Cronbach alpha\\nreliabilities on the three phases respectively were: a=0.70, 0.74, and 0.70.\\nWord spelling Children were asked to write out each of the eight words used in the\\nword recognition task, prompted by drawings. Scores for each letter that the childhad to spell were as follows: A correct letter scored 3 points, a homophonous letter(or medial instead of \\ufb01nal letter, differing in shape on 5 Hebrew letters) scored 2points, and an incorrect letter or no letter scored 0. The score was the percentage ofpoints out of the maximum possible points (see Levin, 2007 ). Cronbach alpha\\nreliabilities on the three phases respectively were: a=0.97, 0.97, and 0.96.\\nLinguistic competencies The \\ufb01ve tasks measuring linguistic competencies were\\nstandardized tests.\\nReceptive vocabulary In the Peabody vocabulary test, adapted to Hebrew (Solberg\\n& Nevo, 1979 ), children were asked to choose the appropriate drawing for the\\nspoken lexical item, and the score was the percentage of items answered correctly.Cronbach alpha reliabilities on the three phases respectively were: a=0.75, 0.72,\\nand 0.73.\\nExpressive vocabulary An antonym test developed and standardized on Israeli\\nchildren (Peyser, Shimborsky, Wolf, & Hazany, 1995 ) included 18 lexical items\\npresented in ascending order of dif\\ufb01culty. Children were asked to say \\u2018\\u2018theJoint activities and literacy 227\\n123\\nopposite\\u2019\\u2019 (e.g., to answer \\u2018\\u2018short\\u2019\\u2019 for the item \\u2018\\u2018tall\\u2019\\u2019). The score was the percentage\\nof correct responses. Cronbach alpha reliabilities on the three phases respectivelywere: a=0.72, 0.72, and 0.71.\\nDe\\ufb01nition test This test assessed children\\u2019s competency in providing appropriately\\ncommunicative, syntactically well-designed, rich, and speci\\ufb01c de\\ufb01nitions of words.The test, developed in English (Snow, Cancino, Gonzalez, & Shriberg 1989 ),\\nunderwent adaptation to Hebrew (Aram & Levin, 2004 ). The test included 14\\nlexical items (e.g., bicycle) presented in a \\ufb01xed order, and children were asked toexplain their meaning: \\u2018\\u2018What is a \\u2026?\\u2019\\u2019 Each of the 14 de\\ufb01nitions was scored\\naccording to Snow et al.\\u2019s ( 1989 ) scale on six categories: de\\ufb01nitional features,\\nfunctional features, examples, descriptive features, synonyms, comparisons, andcommunicative adequacy. The sum of children\\u2019s scores on all six categories for all14 nouns served as the de\\ufb01nitions score. This score was transformed into a\\npercentage score, out of the maximum points gained in this cohort. The inter-item\\nreliability was a=0.91, 0.94, and 0.94.\\nListening comprehension of sentences/story The two tests measuring listening\\ncomprehension were excluded from further analyses owing to their low internalreliabilities. On Listening comprehension of sentences , reliabilities were a=0.42,\\n0.44, and 0.40, and on Listening comprehension of story they were: a=0.37, 0.42,\\nand 0.44. Low reliabilities may have resulted because these tests were adopted froma standardized screening measure for reading-spelling disability, tested by reading\\ncomprehension among grade-school beginners in Israel (Shatil & Nevo, 2007 ). We\\nused this adaptation because, to the best of our knowledge, no standardized listeningcomprehension test was available in Hebrew.\\nProcedure\\nMothers were distributed into the three mediation groups and control group as\\nfollows. First, all mothers were invited by their children\\u2019s kindergarten teacher toparticipate in an 8-week intervention aiming to promote school readiness, whichwould include a workshop and three sessions of videotaping of mother\\u2013childinteraction at home. To begin, mothers in the intervention groups chose one of sixproposed dates to participate in the 3-h opening workshop, without knowledge thatthe workshops differed by content (two workshops each were randomly assigned to\\nthe three mediation groups\\u2014reading, writing, or visuomotor skills). The authors and\\ntwo research assistants gave each workshop. Mothers in the control group were toldthat after being videotaped with their child three times and completing the researchmeasures, they would attend a workshop on school readiness.\\nData collection (for interactive reading, mediation of writing, and alphabetic\\nskills and linguistic competencies) occurred in three phases for the each of the threemediation groups. The pretest took place up to 2\\u20133 weeks prior to the openingworkshop. The immediate posttest was carried out 7\\u20138 weeks later, a few days after\\ntermination of the intervention. The delayed posttest was conducted 2.5 months\\nafter the immediate posttest. Mother\\u2013child joint reading and writing were assessedat home. Children\\u2019s testing took place in their kindergartens.228 I. Levin, D. Aram\\n123\\nResults\\nDifferential effects of the interventions on mother\\u2013child interactive readingPrior to the intervention, the mean number of dialogues initiated by the mother was\\nrather low ( M=4.35) in a book including 22 pages. Almost all those (98%)\\nreferred to the book\\u2019s story or illustrations, and the rest referred to the print or tostory grammar. The child initiated fewer dialogues than the mother ( M=1.64), and\\npractically all of them related to the story or illustrations. Out of all pretest\\ndialogues initiated by the mother or the child, about 18% included maternalscaffolds, 36% included maternal elaborations, 80% included maternal praise, and12% included maternal corrections. These scores, transformed into Zscores, were\\nsummed up and composed the number of enhancing dialogues.\\nTable 1(upper section on joint reading) presents the mean scores on charac-\\nteristics of dyadic reading by group and phase. Table 2(upper section) presents the\\nresults of two-way ANOVAs of these scores, with 4 (group: reading, writing,\\nvisuomotor, control) by 3 (phase: pretest, immediate posttest, delayed posttest), with\\nphase assessed by repeated measures.\\nAnalyses of the three characteristics\\u2014number of maternally initiated dialogues,\\nnumber of child-initiated dialogues, and Zscore of enhancing dialogues\\u2014revealed\\na signi\\ufb01cant interaction of group by phase. To illuminate the source of theinteractions, we carried out Bonferroni comparisons, taking into account the numberof comparisons. Comparing the groups in each phase showed that at the pretest, nogroup differed from each other on any of the characteristics, implying that the\\ngroups were well matched. On the immediate posttest, the storybook reading group\\nsigni\\ufb01cantly surpassed all other groups on all characteristics. The three othergroups\\u2014writing, visuomotor skills, and control\\u2014were statistically indistinguish-able. On the delayed posttest, the storybook reading group outperformed all othergroups on number of mother-initiated dialogues and on enhancing dialogues, but noton number of child-initiated dialogues, and the three other groups were againstatistically indistinguishable.\\nIn the storybook reading group, dyadic reading increased substantially and\\nsigni\\ufb01cantly on all three characteristics from pretest to the immediate posttest. It\\ndeclined signi\\ufb01cantly from the immediate to the delayed posttest only on number ofchild-initiated dialogues. Consequently, the dyadic reading group remainedsigni\\ufb01cantly higher on the delayed posttest than on the pretest regarding its numberof mother-initiated dialogues and enhancing dialogues. In contrast, in the three othergroups (writing, visuomotor, and control) the characteristics of dyadic readingremained statistically indistinguishable between the three phases.\\nAlmost all the dialogues initiated by mothers or children in the pretest\\npertained to the story or illustrations. Guiding mothers on storybook reading\\nmediation signi\\ufb01cantly increased their questions or comments on this topic as wellas on topics that they regularly neglect\\u2014print and story grammar. Nevertheless,dialogues on print and story grammar remained marginal and were not examinedfurther.Joint activities and literacy 229\\n123\\nTable 1 Means (and SDs) of storybook reading, writing mediation, and children\\u2019s literacy, as a function\\nof intervention group and phase ( N=124)\\nGroup Phase\\nPretest\\nM(SD)Immediate posttest\\nM(SD)Delayed posttest\\nM(SD)\\nJoint reading\\nTotal no. of mother-initiated dialogues\\nReading mediation 4.71 (6.49) 15.14 (13.16) 9.94 (8.48)\\nWriting mediation 3.97 (3.60) 5.22 (5.52) 3.56 (4.65)\\nVisuomotor skills mediation 5.77 (5.49) 7.93 (7.98) 4.83 (4.85)No mediation 2.74 (5.65) 3.33 (4.03) 1.56 (2.06)\\nTotal no. of child-initiated dialogues\\nReading mediation 1.66 (2.61) 4.14 (6.18) 1.00 (1.55)\\nWriting mediation 1.66 (3.56) 1.91 (1.99) 1.13 (1.74)\\nVisuomotor skills mediation 2.17 (2.29) 1.90 (2.82) 1.07 (1.70)No mediation 1.00 (2.24) 1.26 (2.64) 0.85 (1.97)\\nTotal no. of enhancing dialogues ( Zscore)\\na\\nReading mediation 0.35 (4.90) 3.02 (5.33) 2.77 (5.08)\\nWriting mediation -0.72 (1.29) -1.47 (1.29) -1.23 (1.33)\\nVisuomotor skills mediation 1.12 (4.90) -0.64 (2.19) -0.53 (2.28)\\nNo mediation -0.84 (2.28) -1.47 (1.57) -1.55 (1.74)\\nJoint writing\\nMean score on grapho-phonemic mediation\\nReading mediation 5.29 (1.62) 6.06 (1.85) 6.56 (1.34)Writing mediation 5.40 (1.25) 7.52 (0.57) 7.74 (0.70)\\nVisuomotor skills mediation 5.14 (1.52) 6.06 (1.85) 6.52 (1.63)\\nNo mediation 5.40 (1.81) 6.42 (1.68) 6.66 (1.83)\\nMean score on printing mediation\\nReading mediation 6.46 (2.55) 7.27 (2.07) 8.27 (1.30)Writing mediation 6.52 (2.30) 8.92 (0.18) 8.92 (0.12)\\nVisuomotor skills mediation 6.44 (2.45) 7.50 (2.36) 8.13 (1.70)\\nNo mediation 6.79 (2.44) 8.04 (1.84) 8.05 (1.66)\\nChildren\\u2019s literacy performance\\nMean percentage score on alphabetic skills\\nReading mediation 35.19 (20.67) 56.44 (24.42) 62.63 (21.70)Writing mediation 36.54 (25.15) 70.17 (23.19) 69.62 (23.33)\\nVisuomotor skills mediation 34.96 (19.21) 56.14 (24.04) 62.79 (24.11)\\nNo mediation 47.72 (25.37) 61.08 (24.02) 65.95 (23.25)\\nMean percentage score on linguistic competencies\\nReading mediation 41.09 (10.74) 43.19 (9.65) 51.41 (13.64)Writing mediation 42.52 (9.13) 43.35 (9.48) 51.05 (10.64)\\nVisuomotor skills mediation 40.50 (9.29) 41.48 (9.24) 49.38 (9.98)\\nNo mediation 40.16 (12.99) 39.53 (11.92) 50.13 (11.49)\\naDialogues including maternal scaffolding, elaboration, reinforcement, and/or correction230 I. Levin, D. Aram\\n123\\nRegression analyses of joint reading\\nNote that all the following regression analyses used the three models described\\nbelow. Model 1 included child\\u2019s age, maternal education, pretest scores, and group;Model 2 added two-way interactions\\u2014group by child\\u2019s age, group by maternaleducation, and child\\u2019s age by maternal education; and Model 3 added a three-wayinteraction\\u2014group by child\\u2019s age by maternal education. Simultaneous regressionanalyses were used so that the unique effect of each predictor was measured after\\ncontrolling for all the rest. All the regression tables present results of Model 1. For\\nbrevity, the very few signi\\ufb01cant interactions are described in the text.\\nTo predict each characteristic of interactive reading during the immediate and\\ndelayed posttests, four predictors were used: the child\\u2019s age, maternal education,performance in pretest on the predicted characteristics (autoregression), and group.The previously cited analyses indicated that an increase in interactivity duringstorybook reading due to the intervention emerged only in the storybook readinggroup. Therefore, to assess group effect, we compared the storybook reading group\\nto the three other groups combined (writing, visuomotor, and control). We tested\\nautoregression: whether those dyads who were more interactive during the pretestcontinued to be more interactive following the intervention on the predictedcharacteristics.

This interaction re\\ufb02ected that in\\nthe reading group, among dyads where mothers had lower education, enhancingdialogues decreased with the child\\u2019s age.

However, on the printing mediation task, none\\nof the four groups differed signi\\ufb01cantly from each other.\\nMaternal grapho-phonemic mediation increased substantially and signi\\ufb01cantly on\\nall groups, from pretest to the immediate posttest, and did not signi\\ufb01cantly changefurther from the immediate to the delayed posttest. Still, on all groups, maternalgrapho-phonemic mediation remained signi\\ufb01cantly higher on the delayed posttestthan on the pretest. Maternal printing mediation increased from pretest to theimmediate posttest in the writing and the control groups, but not in the reading and\\nvisuomotor groups.

On printing mediation, the advantage of the writing group over other groupsappeared to be signi\\ufb01cant only immediately after the intervention. Later on, thegroups retained their higher scores, but the difference between groups did not reach\\nsigni\\ufb01cance. This \\ufb01nding may have stemmed from a ceiling effect.\\nRegression analyses of writing mediationFour predictors were used: the child\\u2019s age, maternal education, performance in\\npretest on the predicted characteristics (autoregression), and group. The previouslycited analyses indicated that an increase in writing mediation due to the interventionemerged only in the joint writing group. Therefore, to assess group effect, we\\ncompared the writing group to the three other groups combined (reading,\\nvisuomotor, and control).\\nImmediate posttest Results of the regressions predicting the immediate posttest\\nappear in Table 3. Pretest scores and group had effects on grapho-phonemic\\nmediation and on printing mediation.\\nOn the grapho-phonemic mediation, a signi\\ufb01cant two-way interaction of child\\u2019s\\nage and maternal education was moderated by a signi\\ufb01cant three-way interaction of\\nchild\\u2019s age, maternal education and group, b=- 0.177, t=- 2.22, p\\\\0.03. This\\ninteraction re\\ufb02ected that mothers in the writing group provided a higher grapho-phonemic mediation at the immediate posttest than in the other groups combined,irrespective of child\\u2019s age. In contrast, in the three groups combined (reading,visuomotor, and control) mothers with higher education provided higher grapho-phonemic mediation to older than to younger children.

It stemmed from the following: Printing mediation decreasedJoint activities and literacy 235\\n123\\nnon-signi\\ufb01cantly with child\\u2019s age among the writing group, and increased non-\\nsigni\\ufb01cantly among the other groups combined.\\nIn sum, the three models combined explained 60% of the variance in maternal\\ngrapho-phonemic mediation and 47% of the variance in printing mediation.\\nDelayed posttest Results of the regressions predicting the delayed posttest appear\\nin Table 4.

In sum, the three models combined explained 40% of the variancein grapho-phonemic mediation and 30% of the variance in printing mediation.\\nChildren\\u2019s performance: con\\ufb01rmatory factor analysisWe attempted to con\\ufb01rm whether the nine administered tests of child literacy\\nmeasured the two expected factors: alphabetic skills (six tests) and linguistic\\ncompetencies (three tests). We added an expected relation between the two\\nalphabetic tests that required responding with an isolated phoneme: the phonemeisolation of words and the letter sounding, which in Hebrew amounts to isolating theinitial phoneme of the letter name.

These results support the hypothesis\\nthat the tests measured two factors: Six measured one factor pertaining to alphabetic\\nskills, and three measured another factor relating to linguistic competencies.\\nTwo composite scores were formed. The alphabetic skills composite score was\\ncreated by averaging the percentage scores on six tests. The Cronbach internalreliabilities across these tests were high on pretest, immediate posttest, and delayedposttest, respectively: a=0.91, 0.92, and 0.92. The linguistic competencies\\ncomposite score was created by averaging the percentage scores on three tests. Thereliabilities across these tests were satisfactory: a=0.67, 0.76, and 0.67.\\nDifferential effects of the interventions on children\\u2019s performance\\nTable 1(bottom section) presents the mean scores on alphabetic skills and linguistic\\ncompetencies by group and phase. Table 2(bottom section) presents the results of\\ntwo-way 4 (group) by 3 (phase) ANOVAs of these scores, with phase assessed byrepeated measures.\\nThe analysis of alphabetic skills revealed a signi\\ufb01cant interaction of group by\\nphase, but no such interaction appeared on linguistic competencies. To illuminate\\nthe source of the interaction on alphabetic skills we carried out Bonferronicomparisons. Unexpectedly, at the pretest, the control group outperformed all othergroups. To control for this difference, we analyzed progress scores from pretest tothe immediate posttest (i.e., immediate posttest minus pretest score), from theimmediate to the delayed posttest (i.e., delayed posttest minus immediate posttest),and from pretest to the delayed posttest (i.e., delayed posttest minus pretest score).The groups were compared on progress scores by one-way ANOVAs. The growth in\\nalphabetic skills from pretest to the immediate posttest was signi\\ufb01cantly higher on\\nthe writing group than on each of the other groups, which did not differ from eachother, F(3,124) =11.92, p\\\\0.001, g\\n2=0.230. The overall growth from pretest to\\nthe delayed posttest remained signi\\ufb01cantly higher on the writing group than on thecontrol group, F(3,124) =4.84, p\\\\0.01,g\\n2=0.108.\\nOn linguistic competencies, all groups improved gradually from pretest to the\\nimmediate posttest (except on the control group) and all groups improved thereafterto the delayed posttest, so that the scores were signi\\ufb01cantly higher on the delayed\\nposttest than on the pretest. However, group by phase interaction was not\\nsigni\\ufb01cant.\\nIn sum, on alphabetic skills children in the writing group surpassed the rest. On\\nlinguistic competencies all groups improved with time, but the interventions had noeffect on this growth.\\nRegression analyses of children\\u2019s alphabetic skills\\nSimultaneous regression analyses were conducted on children\\u2019s alphabetic skills.\\nNo such analysis was carried out on linguistic competencies because interventionhad no effect on this score, as shown by the lack of a signi\\ufb01cant group by phaseJoint activities and literacy 237\\n123\\ninteraction effect. Four predictors were used: the child\\u2019s age, maternal education,\\nalphabetic pretest score, and group. The previously cited analyses indicated that thealphabetic skills improved due to the intervention only in the joint writing group.\\nTherefore, to assess the group effect, we compared the writing group to the three\\nother groups combined (reading, visuomotor, and control). Tables 3and4(bottom\\npart) present Model 1 of the regression analysis.

In sum,the three models combined explained 69% of the variance in immediate alphabeticscores, and 61% of the variance in delayed alphabetic scores.\\nDiscussion\\nInteractive reading and writing mediation: implementation and transferThe \\ufb01rst goal of this study was to explore whether guiding low-SES mothers to\\nmediate learning in one joint activity would directly affect the same activity as well\\nas be transferred to another joint activity. We focused on two activities: interactive\\nreading and writing mediation. We expected that coaching mothers in readingstorybooks interactively would improve reading quality more than coaching them inother joint activities like writing or visuomotor skills. In the same vein, we expectedthat guiding mothers to mediate writing would improve their quality of writingmediation more than guiding them in interactive reading or visuomotor skills.Moreover, we investigated transfer effects, to determine whether guiding mothers insome other joint activity would contribute to interactive storybook reading on the\\none hand, and to writing mediation on the other hand, more than would no\\nintervention.\\nResults were consistent for both types of activities. Coaching mothers on each\\nactivity had impressive effects on the targeted activity only. In other words,implementation of each program succeeded, but mothers did not generalize thelearned principles of mediation to the other non-coached joint activities. The failureof transfer will be discussed later.\\nThe effects of reading intervention on interactive reading were remarkable in the\\ncontext of the habitual storybook reading characteristics demonstrated among these\\nlow-SES mothers before intervention. Reading characteristics in the pretest weresimilar to those that appeared in the literature that has mainly addressed youngerchildren and higher or mixed SES populations. First, the literature indicates that inhabitual storybook reading mothers rarely engage the child (Huebner & Meltzoff,2005 ). Likewise, we found that the number of dialogues initiated by mothers was\\nrelatively low, with the mean number around four. Second, the amount ofmaternally initiated dialogues during habitual reading is known to vary substantially\\nacross mothers (Briesch et al., 2008 ; Curenton, Craig, & Flanigan, 2008 ; Yaden,\\n2003 ). Indeed, the number of dialogues initiated by the current sample of mothers\\nvaried greatly, ranging from no dialogues during the entire reading to more than one238 I. Levin, D. Aram\\n123\\nper page. Third, mothers are known to usually contribute more to the discourse\\nduring reading than do their children (Curenton et al.). Similarly, the currentmothers contributed about three times more dialogues than did their children.\\nFinally, as noted in the text, mothers initiated dialogues during reading that focused\\nalmost entirely on the story and illustrations and often ignored the print and storygrammar. Overlooking of print, even when the children are kindergartners on theverge of starting school the next year, may stem from the possible distractive effectit may have on the ongoing processing of the story. Ignoring story grammar mayre\\ufb02ect mothers\\u2019 limited comprehension that the particular text is a materialization ofa general scheme of narrative that can help in text comprehension.\\nCoaching mothers in interactive reading enhanced their reading quality in both\\nthe immediate and the delayed posttests. In the immediate posttest, mothers tripled\\nthe number of dialogues they initiated and doubled the number of enhancingdialogues, thereby greatly increasing their children\\u2019s discourse during reading.Remarkably, the children themselves initiated more dialogues\\u2014asking questions,demanding clari\\ufb01cations\\u20142.5 times more after the intervention. In the delayedposttest, 2.5 months after the intervention, mothers\\u2019 interactive reading skills(initiating dialogues and providing enhancing dialogues) slightly decreased butsustained their heightened level relative to the pretest. However, the children did\\nnot maintain their high level of initiating dialogues, although they continued to\\nparticipate in dialogues initiated by their mothers. These results corroborate previous\\ufb01ndings on delayed posttests for trained interactive reading (Huebner & Meltzoff,2005 ).\\nWriting mediation improved signi\\ufb01cantly from pretest to the immediate posttest,\\nand furthermore sustained its higher level thereafter, in the delayed posttest, in allfour groups. Nonetheless, writing mediation level in the writing group at theimmediate and the delayed posttests surpassed its level in the other three groups,\\nwho were indistinguishable.\\nA prominent difference emerged between the effects on interactive reading and\\non writing mediation in the respective groups coached in these activities. Amongmothers coached in writing mediation, the variances of maternal writing mediationdecreased remarkably in the two posttests relatively to the pretest, but not in theother three groups. No such variance decrease occurred among mothers coached oninteractive reading at the posttests relatively to the pretest (see Table 1). Such a\\nsustained high variance in interactivity following intervention was also found in a\\nprevious study (Huebner & Meltzoff, 2005 ). The decrease in variance in the writing\\ngroup implies that most mothers in the writing group learned to mediate writing on asimilarly high level, approaching a ceiling effect.\\nNo parallel success appeared on interactive reading, and this deserves consid-\\neration. To involve the child in an ongoing series of challenging dialogues whilereading a story aloud to the child is a demanding task. It requires attendingsimultaneously to the story being read, to the dif\\ufb01culties it can pose to the listeningchild, and to the opportunities the text offers for enhancing the child\\u2019s language and\\nstory comprehension. Mothers may differ either in their ability to perform such a\\ndemanding task or in their motivation to cope with it persistently.Joint activities and literacy 239\\n123\\nWhy transfer failed to occur\\nThe expectation was refuted that guiding mothers in other joint activities would\\nimprove interactive storybook reading or writing mediation, relatively to the controlgroup (no intervention). This lack of transfer coincides with a previous \\ufb01nding showingno transfer from enriched conversation in toy play to interactive reading amongchildren with language impairments (Dale et al., 1996 ). However, the theoretical\\nunderstanding and educational pro\\ufb01t to be gained from studying transfer to interactive\\nreading justify deeper scrutiny of this issue. In general terms, the rich literature shows\\nthat transfer of training is a highly regarded but not very common outcome of training,with the reasons not being entirely clear (Salomon & Perkins, 1989 ).\\nThe explanations for lack of transfer to interactive reading on the one hand, and\\nto writing mediation on the other hand, may differ. Many mothers who were nottrained to read interactively were in the habit of reading storybooks to their children(as indicated in maternal reports), and this may account for the resistance ofstorybook reading interactivity to change. Further, parents have been found to view\\nstorybook reading as a context for bonding with the child and a time of enjoyment,\\nmore than as a context for learning (Audet, Evans, Williamson, & Reynolds, 2008 ).\\nTherefore, unless parents endorse the view that storybook reading is a teaching\\u2013learning opportunity, and are encouraged to read interactively and guided in how todo so, parents may be unaware of other ways of reading that might be productive.\\nHigh level writing mediation requires understanding of the process of inventing\\nspellings of words: segmenting the word into abstract sound units, connecting eachunit to a letter based on its name or sound, and printing the letter. This is quite a\\ndifferent process from that carried out by a mastered speller who already employs\\nword-speci\\ufb01c orthographic knowledge. Therefore, mothers who did not participatein the writing intervention and speci\\ufb01cally learn to mediate writing may not beaware of the process required from the child while inventing spelling. Further,mothers having little experience of joint writing with their children may not beaware of their children\\u2019s relevant knowledge, and may suf\\ufb01ce with dictating therequired letters\\u2014a rather mediocre mediation.\\nPretest\\u2013posttest continuity, child\\u2019s age, and maternal education\\nTwo predictors emerged consistently as predominant in regressions predicting\\ninteractive reading and writing mediation in the immediate and the delayedposttests: First, pretest scores uniquely predicted posttests scores, implying thatmothers who surpassed their counterparts prior to the intervention continued tooutdo them following the intervention at both posttest intervals. In the same vein,mothers who prior to the intervention scored higher than their counterparts on\\nwriting mediation continued to surpass them in the two posttests. These \\ufb01ndings\\nshow that individual differences between mothers were not eliminated byintervention effects, when intervention effects (as well as other predictors) werecontrolled. Secondly, group uniquely predicted interactive reading and writingmediation: Mothers coached on one activity surpassed the rest on that activity, evenafter controlling for all other predictors.240 I. Levin, D. Aram\\n123\\nA recent meta-analysis showed that children\\u2019s age and maternal education had\\neffects on children\\u2019s vocabulary growth due to interactive reading relative to regularreading (Mol et al., 2008 ). Referring to age, the effect of interactive reading on\\nchildren\\u2019s vocabulary has been found to decrease with children\\u2019s age, from 2\\u20133 to\\n4\\u20136 years old, becoming negligible in the older samples. The authors suggest thatolder children perhaps need less parental interactive reading, becoming better ableto monitor story comprehension and ask questions on their own.\\nOur cohort was older than most samples studied thus far, as it included only\\nkindergartners, with a mean age of 5;4. Still, the age effect reported above waspartially supported in our analyses: In the immediate posttest, those mothers withlow education who were coached on interactive reading initiated more enhancing\\ndialogues in reading to younger than to older children. In the delayed posttest, all\\nmothers coached on interactive reading (irrespective of their education) initiatedmore enhancing dialogues in reading to younger than to older children. These\\ufb01ndings suggest that maternal interactive reading tends to decline when children getolder, as mothers possibly believe that their children need less assistance(DeTemple, 2001 ), and this belief seems to be held more by mothers of lower\\neducation (among our low-SES mothers).\\nNote that parents tend to overestimate their preschoolers\\u2019 early literacy (Hiebert\\n& Adams, 1987 ), so that mothers may be unaware that their children need assistance\\nduring storybook reading. In addition, mothers with lower education, within asample of low-SES mothers, may have greater dif\\ufb01culty in crafting challengingquestions that would lead to high-quality discourse, including scaffolds andelaborations, for older children.\\nThe effect of age on maternal writing mediation was diametrically different than\\nthe picture portrayed above. Mothers in the writing group provided high grapho-phonemic mediation in the posttests, irrespective of the child\\u2019s age. Mothers in the\\nthree groups combined (reading, visuomotor, and control) provided higher grapho-\\nphonemic mediation to older than to younger children. Possibly these mothersincreased their level of mediation in response to children\\u2019s growth in alphabeticskills and invented spelling. No clear effects emerged of children\\u2019s age or maternaleducation on maternal printing.\\nEffects on children\\u2019s alphabetic skills and linguistic competencies\\nA major question of this study was whether due to the intervention programs,\\nenhanced writing mediation in the writing group would promote children\\u2019salphabetic skills, whereas enhanced interactive storybook reading in the readinggroup would promote children\\u2019s vocabulary. Such differential effects of jointwriting as opposed to storybook reading gained support in correlative studies (Aram& Levin, 2002 ; Hood et al., 2008 ;S e\\u00b4ne\\u00b4chal & LeFevre, 2002 ). However, in a single\\nintervention study, implemented in small groups of kindergartners, joint writing didenhance alphabetic skills more than interactive storybook reading, but interactive\\nreading failed to enhance children\\u2019s linguistic competencies more than joint writing\\n(Aram & Biron, 2004 ).Joint activities and literacy 241\\n123\\nResults of the current study are in line with the \\ufb01ndings of Aram and Biron\\n(2004 ). Maternal mediation of writing was found to be the most productive activity\\nin enhancing alphabetic skills, as measured by letter knowledge, phonological\\nawareness, word spelling, and decoding, but maternal interactive storybook reading\\nfailed to promote linguistic competencies, as measured by receptive and expressivevocabulary and the word de\\ufb01nition test.\\nIn general, alphabetic skills appeared as substantially more malleable to promotion\\nthan linguistic competencies. From pretest to the immediate posttest, alphabetic skillsimproved by 90% in the writing mediation group and by 30% in the control group.Linguistic competencies, in comparison, improved by only 5% in the joint reading groupand not at all in the control group (see Table 1). The discrepancy between these volumes\\nof change can be explained by the different nature of these domains that is exhibited in\\ntheir testing. Alphabetic skills, particularly letter knowledge and phonologicalawareness, are rather speci\\ufb01c skills referring to a closed class of knowledge. In mostalphabetic languages, the number of letters that the child has to remember by shape,name, and sound is less than 30 (in Hebrew: 27). The number of phonemes to which thechild should become sensitive is also quite limited (in Hebrew less than 20 consonantalphonemes). Assessment of these skills practically measures the entire knowledge base(within the constraints of the speci\\ufb01c task). In contrast, expressive and receptive\\nvocabulary, as well as learning to de\\ufb01ne concepts (the linguistic skills measured here)\\nare broad competencies that grow for years. Their assessment involves only a limitedsample, assumed to be representative, of the entire knowledge base. For instance, PPVTmeasured understanding of about 60 items, which is a very small sample ofkindergartners\\u2019 receptive vocabulary. Naturally, this characteristic of linguisticcompetency allows for only gross assessment of the construct.\\nHence, in intervention studies that are limited in time, gains are dif\\ufb01cult to\\ncapture using general tests that do not measure the particular items targeted by\\nmediated reading. Had we assessed vocabulary improvement by using words that\\nthe parents read or discussed with the child during interactive book reading, thechances would have increased for \\ufb01nding substantial bene\\ufb01ts in the joint readinggroup, relative to the other groups (Aram, 2006 ).\\nIn this study, joint writing that involves parental mediation appeared to be an\\nef\\ufb01cient practice for promoting alphabetic skills, which are important for readingand writing acquisition. However, joint writing is often considered by parents to bea school-like activity and thus unsuitable for parent\\u2013child joint entertainment. In\\ncontrast, joint reading is viewed by many children, parents, and educators as\\nengaging. These differential conceptions could be culturally transformed bymotivating children to learn the alphabetic code. This could be done by introducingentertaining games for such learning, like writing friends\\u2019 names on birthdayinvitations, making a grocery list, or writing a note to grandmother. According toour impression, most dyads in the current study enjoyed writing together as well aslearning skills related to writing\\u2014letter knowledge, word segmentation, andgrapho-phonemic awareness. In a recent study (Levin & Ehri, 2009 ), kindergartners,\\nparticularly those advanced on letter knowledge, learned on their own to recognize\\nand spell many of their classmates\\u2019 names, displayed in the classroom, without anyencouragement on the part of their teachers.242 I. Levin, D. Aram\\n123\\nThis study calls for analyzing differential effects of other parent\\u2013child joint\\nactivities. After all, parents spend long hours playing with their young children, andpossible contributions of this natural activity can be knowledgably used to advance\\nchildren\\u2019s cognitive and literate development.\\nAcknowledgments The authors extend their thanks to the Israeli Academy of Science for supporting\\nthis study, to Limor Nuhi, Netanel Kabala, Sivan Shatil-Karmon, and Sigalit Aviram for theircontributions to the study, and to Dee Ankonina for her editorial assistance.

It is essential for children\\nto gain narrative knowledge so as to discuss and organize their lives into meaningful episodes. To\\nbe understood by naive conversational partners, however, it is suggested that children\\u2019s stories need\\nto be structured chronologically, include causal links to the goals and motivations of characters, and\\nprovide suf\\ufb01cient background information ( Peterson, 1994 ). This story construction knowledge is usu-\\nally assumed to develop through parent\\u2013child routines. One routine is shared book reading.\\nInterestingly, correlational studies suggest that early narrative skills are related to children\\u2019s later\\nliteracy development, with moderate to strong relations existing between the production of \\ufb01ctional\\nnarratives and concurrent, as well as future, reading comprehension ( Grif\\ufb01n, Hemphill, Camp, & Wolf,\\n2004; O\\u2019Neill, Pearce, & Pick, 2004; Snow, Porche, Tabors, & Harris, 2007 ). However, although correla-\\ntional research has found links between story construction skills and literacy, there is a lack of con-\\ncrete evidence supporting a causal relationship between shared book reading and storytelling skills.\\nIn the current study, we examined whether shared book reading was causally linked to \\ufb01ctional nar-\\nrative construction abilities.\\nNarrative construction skills undergo extensive development between 2 and 5 years of age, begin-\\nning with toddlers uttering single-phrase two-word utterances and ending with complex multiepisod-\\nic stories. At 5 years of age, typically developing children from middle-income homes are able to\\nproduce narratives that are chronologically structured and sequential, although these stories often\\nend abruptly without proper conclusions ( Peterson & McCabe, 1983 ). In addition, 5-year-olds are able\\nto include some words, such as andand then, that connect sentences together cohesively (Peterson &\\nMcCabe, 1991) and are able to include enough details about characters to allow a naive listener to\\nunderstand who are the protagonists and what are some of their thoughts and motivations ( Stein &\\nGlenn, 1979 ).\\nNarrative skills do not develop at the same rate in all children; children from low-income house-\\nholds, for example, have been found to have de\\ufb01cits in storytelling skills when compared with their\\npeers from middle-income households ( Peterson, 1994 ). Given the discrepancy in narrative skills\\nacross economic populations, the development of narrative skills cannot be governed entirely by mat-\\nuration. Instead, it is theorized that children acquire storytelling skills through social interaction.\\nVygotskian theory suggests that parents \\u2018\\u2018scaffold\\u201d their children into developing better narrative\\nskills ( Vygotsky, 1978 ). More simply, during dialogues with learned others, children encounter narra-\\ntives that are more sophisticated than their own and internalize the skills that allow them to improve\\ntheir own constructions.\\nSupport for this notion is found in intervention studies that focused on the development of auto-\\nbiographical stories. These intervention studies showed that training mothers to ask more elaborative,\\nopen-ended \\u2018\\u2018wh-\\u201d questions while engaging in autobiographical narrative dialogues with children\\nimproved the quality of narratives produced by 3- to 5-year-olds ( Peterson, Jesso, & McCabe, 1999 ).\\nIn addition, parents can tailor questions asked to improve speci\\ufb01c aspects of narrative skills ( Peterson\\n& McCabe, 2004 ). For example, parents can scaffold children to better contextualize their narratives by\\nasking for more context detail in their questioning (e.g., who, what, when, where). Thus, through feed-\\nback from their conversation partners, children encode the relevant information on autobiographical\\nstorytelling that is emphasized in joint discussion ( Nelson, 2007 ).\\nIn addition to the study of autobiographical narrative knowledge as described above, researchers\\nhave investigated children\\u2019s acquisition of \\ufb01ctional narrative knowledge (e.g., Mandler, 1984; Stein\\n& Glenn, 1979 ). Telling \\ufb01ctional stories seems to be an important skill linked to later literacy develop-\\nment given that 12 of the 15 investigations on the relation between narratives and literacy that were\\nfound required children to tell \\ufb01ctional stories unassisted by a conversational partner (for critical anal-\\nyses of six of these articles, see O\\u2019Neill et al., 2004 ; Roth, Speece, Cooper, & De la Paz, 1996). Moreover,\\n\\ufb01ctional storytelling, prompted by wordless picture books or other stimuli, is often used by speech\\nlanguage pathologists to assess oral language delays ( Melzi & Caspe, 2008 ). Given the relationship be-\\ntween \\ufb01ctional narratives and later literacy, it is important to understand how and in what contexts\\nchildren might acquire information on \\ufb01ctional narrative construction.\\nOne context that might promote \\ufb01ctional narrative knowledge is book reading. The illustrations\\nthemselves in picture books may help to foster the acquisition of \\ufb01ctional narrative knowledge. Paris2 R. Lever, M. S\\u00e9n\\u00e9chal / Journal of Experimental Child Psychology 108 (2011) 1\\u201324\\nand Paris (2003) suggested that young children learn to \\u2018\\u2018read\\u201d the pictures in a picture book to ascer-\\ntain the meanings of narrative components and add these understandings to their narrative schemas.\\nHowever, young children\\u2019s main exposure to books typically occurs during adult\\u2013child shared book\\nreading. In these activities, adults may give information about the plot, supporting the narrative ele-\\nments found in the illustrations and, thus, emphasizing narrative knowledge ( Graham, 1990 ). For\\nexample, a picture of a boy crying may help children to understand the character\\u2019s emotional response\\nto an event, and a parent may explain the picture to the child in terms of the events causing the child\\u2019s\\ntears, thereby highlighting elements of narrative plot.\\nHowever, during shared book reading, parents may be supplying narrative knowledge in other\\nways than simply reading the text and explaining pictures. Shared reading provides a context where\\ndialogues about the \\ufb01ctional stories in storybooks can be created, and these dialogues could empha-\\nsize narrative elements that are present both in pictures and in the text. Parents may ask and answer\\nquestions during shared reading, thereby creating a dialogic environment that contains many oppor-\\ntunities for adults to scaffold narrative elements in a manner similar to adult\\u2013child dialogues about\\npast events. In the current study, the focus was on the possibility of children learning \\ufb01ctional narra-tive skills from shared adult\\u2013child reading.\\nPast research has not found a de\\ufb01nitive answer as to whether or not shared reading in\\ufb02uences chil-\\ndren\\u2019s narrative knowledge. S\\u00e9n\\u00e9chal, Pagan, Lever, and Ouellette (2008) did not \\ufb01nd an association\\nbetween the frequency of shared reading at home and children\\u2019s ability to produce narratives, either\\n\\ufb01ctional or autobiographical. That study, however, did not assess the quality of the parent\\u2013child inter-\\nactions during shared reading. Investigation of the natural reading behaviors of parents with their pre-\\nschoolers found that parents do not typically engage in interactive reading with their children\\n(Whitehurst et al., 1988 ). In fact, parents\\u2019 reading styles typically include few dialogues, and these dia-\\nlogues involve mainly yes/no questions or directives. Most often, parents read the text directly with-\\nout engaging their children in the story or the discourse ( Huebner & Meltzoff, 2005 ). Is it the case that\\nshared reading enhances children\\u2019s narrative skills only when adults adopt a dialogic interaction style\\nduring shared reading?\\nRecognizing that a more active role in storybook reading may be bene\\ufb01cial to children\\u2019s literacy\\ndevelopment, Whitehurst et al. (1988) designed an intervention called dialogic reading that is meant\\nto encourage adults to create dialogues during story time (see Mol, Bus, de Jong, & Smeets, 2008 ,\\nfor an up-to-date meta-analysis of the dialogic reading literature). During reading sessions, the adult\\nreader is required to encourage children\\u2019s oral contributions using elaborative \\u2018\\u2018wh-\\u201d and open-ended\\nquestions, repetition of good responses, and expansion of incomplete responses to illustrate the differ-\\nence between what was said and what could have been said. This reading technique has been found to\\npositively impact literacy skills in young children; in particular, most of the research conducted on this\\ntype of intervention has focused on the impact of dialogic reading on expressive vocabulary. In fact,\\npositive gains in expressive vocabulary were found in children between 3 and 5 years of age ( Crain-\\nThoreson & Dale, 1999; Lonigan & Whitehurst, 1998; Wasik & Bond, 2001; Whitehurst, Arnold,\\net al., 1994; Whitehurst, Epstein, et al., 1994 ) when conducted in groups of up to eight children ( Har-\\ngrave & S\\u00e9n\\u00e9chal, 2000; Lonigan & Whitehurst, 1998; Whitehurst, Arnold, et al., 1994 ) and when com-\\npared with an alternative treatment comparison group ( Arnold, Lonigan, Whitehurst, & Epstein, 1994;\\nLonigan & Whitehurst, 1998; Valdez-Menchaca & Whitehurst, 1992; Whitehurst, Arnold, et al., 1994 ).\\nYoung children are clearly internalizing language knowledge highlighted by interactive shared\\nreading.\\nAlthough the dialogic reading literature focuses on improving vocabulary skills, the types of \\u2018\\u2018wh-\\u201d\\nquestions used to create dialogues about storybooks are not unlike the elaborative questions that have\\nbeen found to improve children\\u2019s narrative skills. Therefore, it is hypothesized that using this dialogic\\nreading procedure, in the context of books that highlight story elements, would impact narrative skills.A search of the published literature yielded a single study testing the impact of dialogic reading on\\nnarrative knowledge. Zevenbergen, Whitehurst, and Zevenebergen (2003) determined that using a\\ndialogic reading intervention could enhance children\\u2019s inclusion of some important aspects of narra-\\ntives within their retellings of heard stories such as children\\u2019s inclusion of more details about the char-\\nacters\\u2019 mental states, motivation, and dialogues. However, that study was limited to investigating only\\na few aspects of narrative knowledge in a retelling paradigm. The current study was conducted toR. Lever, M. S\\u00e9n\\u00e9chal / Journal of Experimental Child Psychology 108 (2011) 1\\u201324 3\\ndetermine whether a dialogic reading intervention could enhance a wider range of narrative compo-\\nnents in both a retelling and production paradigm. These components are meant to represent the dif-\\nferent areas of narrative knowledge that children would need to grasp so as to create chronological,\\ncomplex, cohesive, and contextual narratives.\\nComponents of narrative skillsKnowledge about narrative structure\\nTo measure a child\\u2019s structural knowledge, the narratives are analyzed for the story elements that\\nmake up a story grammar. A story grammar is a sequence of elements that are essential to a structured\\nstory plot, and as such they include introductions, setting details, character descriptions and emo-\\ntional/cognitive responses of the characters, initiating events, plans to solve con\\ufb02icts, attempts to\\nsolve con\\ufb02icts, reactions to events, and conclusions ( Stein & Glenn, 1979 ). Story grammar units are\\nthe basic elements of a story that organize story events in a sequential and meaningful way. In fact,\\nthe structure of a narrative is considered to be equivalent to the gist or central meaning of a story\\n(Mandler, 1984 ). Internal responses and internal plan story grammar units were assessed separately\\nas a subset of narrative structure called mental state references. This was done to con\\ufb01rm \\ufb01ndings\\nbyZevenbergen et al. (2003) .\\nLinguistic knowledge\\nMeasures of language complexity that demonstrate a child\\u2019s ability to produce linguistic compo-\\nnents within the narratives were used. These measures include the total number of words, the ratio\\nof number of different words spoken over total number of words, and the mean length of utterances.\\nThe ratio of different words to total words re\\ufb02ects the amount of varied language used and expresses\\nthe complexity of the child\\u2019s narrative language. Furthermore, the mean length of utterances was cal-\\nculated to determine whether the child was more likely to have longer and more complex syntax. This\\nmeasure was \\ufb01rst described as a measure of language complexity by Brown (1973) and subsequently\\nwas used as a measure of syntactic knowledge for children up to 5 years of age ( Bishop & Adams, 1990;\\nMiller & Chapman, 1981 ).\\nContextual knowledge\\nA child\\u2019s use of decontextualized language such as anaphora can serve as an index of contextual\\nknowledge. Anaphora is a linguistic term for an expression referring to a previously mentioned idea.\\nWhen a character is introduced, it is appropriate to \\ufb01rst mention this character by his or her name or\\nthe title of the being preceded by an inde\\ufb01nite article. For example, the proper way to introduce a rab-\\nbit character is to call him or her a rabbit orSam. Once a character has been introduced within the fo-\\ncus of the discourse, it is acceptable to refer the character by a pronoun or another appropriate label\\nsuch as heorthe rabbit in the case of the bunny character. Young children, however, have dif\\ufb01culty\\nwith this grammar rule and often assume shared knowledge with a naive listener and introduce char-\\nacters in their narratives as heorshe(Hickmann & Hendriks, 1999 ).\\nCohesion knowledge\\nThe integration of structure, content knowledge, and linguistic knowledge can be assessed by\\ncounting the number and variety of connectives produced (Peterson & McCabe, 1991). Connectives\\nare said to tie the story together by semantically relating clauses together. It may be the story gram-\\nmar units that structure the overall narrative, but the connectives act to link the story together at the\\nlocal clausal level ( Cain, 2003 ). Higher quality narratives might differ not only in the number of con-\\nnectives but also in the variety of connectives used. Therefore, the appropriate use of cohesive ties was\\nmeasured in the current study.\\nRetelling and production paradigms\\nWithin the \\ufb01eld of \\ufb01ctional narrative research, no consensus has been determined on the narrative\\nparadigm that best assesses a child\\u2019s narrative construction ability. Two main types of tasks dominate4 R. Lever, M. S\\u00e9n\\u00e9chal / Journal of Experimental Child Psychology 108 (2011) 1\\u201324\\nthe \\ufb01eld: narrative retelling tasks and narrative production tasks. Narrative retelling tasks are so\\nnamed because participants are \\ufb01rst told an oral story and then asked to retell this story at some point\\nthereafter; however, the prompt, procedure, listener, time period, and medium vary across the liter-\\nature. In any given retelling task, a participant may be asked to retell a story in the presence of a famil-\\niar listener ( Merritt & Liles, 1989 ) or a naive listener ( Botting, 2002 ) and based on a series of pictures\\nor a picture book ( Hesketh, 2004 ), a video ( Merritt & Liles, 1989 ), a \\ufb01lm strip ( Coelho, 2002 ), a purely\\noral narrative with no props ( Ukrainetz et al., 2005 ), and so on.\\nNarrative production tasks, alternatively, are tasks in which participants are asked to produce a no-\\nvel \\ufb01ctional narrative based on an initial prompt. Similar to retelling tasks, production tasks have a\\nvariety of contexts and methods that are not standardized. For example, participants may be asked\\nto produce a \\ufb01ctional story based on story stems (the \\ufb01rst sentence of a story [ Merritt & Liles,\\n1989 ]), one picture ( Coelho, 2002 ), several pictures ( Hickmann & Hendriks, 1999 ), a wordless story-\\nbook ( Botting, 2002 ), a video ( Eaton, Collis, & Lewis, 1999 ), and so on.\\nBecause no consensus on the type of task, even within the retelling or production genres, can be\\nachieved, it seems ill advised to treat retelling and production tasks as tasks that elicit equivalentnarrative skills. In fact, comparison studies have suggested that the retelling task may be easier for\\nchildren, resulting in children demonstrating a more logically structured, linguistically complex, con-\\nnected and contextualized story than when they are asked to produce a novel story ( Merritt & Liles,\\n1989 ). Furthermore, it is possible that the retelling task is more a measure of children\\u2019s comprehension\\nof story elements than a measure of their ability to construct a narrative ( Nelson, 2007 ). In the current\\nstudy, both narrative production and retelling tasks were assessed to distinguish any differing effects of\\nshared book reading on these two paradigms.\\nThe current study\\nThis study tested whether a shared reading intervention would improve kindergartners\\u2019 narrative\\nability as compared with children receiving an alternative treatment. The intervention was adminis-\\ntered in small groups twice a week for 8 weeks. It was hypothesized that dialogic reading should en-\\nhance the four key aspects of narrative ability\\u2014story structure, language complexity, cohesion, and\\ndecontextualized language\\u2014through the appropriate use of anaphora. Furthermore, the retelling task\\nshould be easier for children to complete; therefore, the effects of the intervention should be more dis-\\ncernible in the children\\u2019s retelling stories.\\nMethods\\nParticipants\\nParticipants were 40 English-speaking 5-year-olds who were recruited from kindergarten pro-\\ngrams in a large city in central Canada. The kindergarten classrooms were in schools identi\\ufb01ed by their\\nschool board as located in neighborhoods that have high concentrations of low-income households\\nand greater mobility of residents than neighborhoods for other schools in the school board district.\\nHowever, a letter sent home through teachers to parents asking for consent for their children\\u2019s\\ninvolvement in the study also asked for information on socioeconomic status (SES), and it appears that\\nparents who gave permission for their children to participate in this study re\\ufb02ected a more varied in-\\ncome level. Of the entire sample, 73% of parents provided information about their highest level of edu-\\ncation achieved and 85% of parents provided annual income information. Of the parents who indicated\\ntheir highest level of education, 6% had not completed high school, 29% were high school educated,\\n24% were college educated, 21% had university degrees, and 21% were completing or had completed\\npostgraduate studies. Furthermore, in terms of parents\\u2019 income, 31% reported an annual income of less\\nthan $20,000,\\n114% reported an annual income between $20,000 and $39,999, 10.3% reported an annual\\nincome between $40,000 and $59,999, 24% reported an annual income between $60,000 and $79,999,\\nand 21% reported an annual income of $80,000 or more.\\n1All incomes reported are in Canadian dollars.R. Lever, M. S\\u00e9n\\u00e9chal / Journal of Experimental Child Psychology 108 (2011) 1\\u201324 5\\nNone of the participating children had hearing dif\\ufb01culties or were receiving speech therapy. In\\naddition, their pretest scores did not reveal dif\\ufb01culty in understanding instructions due to English\\nas a second language, and their receptive vocabulary scores were within 2.5 standard deviations of\\nthe sample mean.\\nSelected children were randomly assigned on the school level to either the dialogic reading group\\nor the alternative treatment group regardless of classroom. Due to group assignment error, uneven\\ngroups were created, with 21 children (9 boys and 12 girls) being assigned to the dialogic reading\\nintervention condition and 19 children (9 boys and 10 girls) being assigned to the alternative treat-\\nment group. The dialogic reading children had a mean age of 5 years 4 months ( SD= 3.6 months) at\\nthe date of pretest, and the alternative treatment children had a mean age of 5 years 3 months\\n(SD= 4.9 months). Finally, 75% of the participants came from homes where English was the language\\nspoken most often. Of the remaining 25%, four children in the dialogic reading group and six children\\nin the alternative treatment group spoke another language most often at home. Other languages spo-\\nken most often in the homes of children in the sample were Chinese, Somali, Urdu, Turkish, Amharic,\\nArabic, Persian, and Bengali.\\nMeasuresNarrative measures\\nFictional narrative ability was measured using the Edmonton Narrative Norms Instrument (ENNI)\\n(Schneider, Dub\\u00e9, & Hayward, 2002 ). The ENNI is a storytelling assessment tool for 4- to 9-year-olds\\nand normalized on a sample of 377 children in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. The tool includes four word-\\nless black and white picture books that portray a series of stories. The books are divided into two sets of\\npicture books depicting illustrated animal characters in obvious con\\ufb02ict-based plots. One set is illus-\\ntrated to depict stories about a giraffe and an elephant at a pool (pool series), and the other set is illus-\\ntrated to depict stories about a mouse and a dog at a park (park series). Each set contains a short picture\\nbook and a long picture book. The short picture books are \\ufb01ve pages long and depict one complete story\\ngrammar episode. The short picture books were used for the pretest portion of the current study. The\\nlong picture books are 14 pages long and contain three complete story grammar episodes about the same\\ntwo main characters, with an additional two characters being added in the second and third episodes,\\nrespectively. These long picture books were used for the posttest version of the study.\\nAlthough the ENNI is a production narrative task only, for the purpose of the study, a retelling task\\nwas designed with novel narratives based on the same wordless picture books that were used for pro-\\nducing narratives; that is, texts (presented in Appendix A) that correspond to the pictures for the pool\\nbooks (short and long) and the park books (short and long) were created. The texts describe the plots\\nof the books and include the appropriate number of story grammar units that are meant to be depicted\\nin each story. In addition, they were designed to be comparable in length, description, dialogue, and\\nemotive language to the other short or long story. As such, the short pool story was 177 words long\\nand the short park story was 172 words long. Similarly, the long pool story was 410 words long\\nand the long park story was 416 words long.\\nIn the narrative retelling task, the participants were expected to listen carefully to the examiner-\\ncreated story that was read aloud to them (see Appendix A). Immediately afterward, the participants\\nwere asked to retell the same story back to the experimenter and were told that their version of the\\nstory would be audiotaped. For each participant, the experimenter held the book facing the child and\\ntold the child that he or she could not see the pictures, nor could the people who would listen to the\\ntapes, so the child needed to tell the story really well to be understood. If the child had trouble in\\nbeginning the narrative or stopped halfway through it, the experimenter was allowed to prompt\\nthe child to continue according to a list of prompts included in the ENNI ( Schneider et al., 2002 ). Per-\\nmissible prompts included questions such as \\u2018\\u2018How would you start your story?\\u201d and \\u2018\\u2018Look at the pic-\\ntures\\u2014what do you think is happening in the story?\\u201d The examiner was allowed to ask six prompts\\nbefore turning the page if the child still did not respond. If the child could not get started after two\\npages, testing was terminated.\\nIn the production task, the procedure followed closely the original task design of the ENNI. The chil-\\ndren were shown pictures in the second wordless picture book that had not been used previously and6 R. Lever, M. S\\u00e9n\\u00e9chal / Journal of Experimental Child Psychology 108 (2011) 1\\u201324\\nwere told that they were required to create their own story based on the pictures. For each participant,\\nafter the child was shown all of the pictures, the examiner held the book facing the child and asked the\\nchild to begin telling the story. Again, the experimenter told the child that he or she could not see the\\npictures, nor could the people who would listen to the tapes, and that he or she would not properly\\nunderstand the story if it was not told well.\\nAll narrative tasks were recorded onto audio disks that were later transcribed according to the Con-\\nventions for the Human Analysis of Transcripts (CHAT) ( MacWhinney, 2000 ). The Child Language\\nAnalysis (CLAN) program, available from the Child Language Data Exchange System (CHILDES) ( Mac-\\nWhinney, 2000 ), is an analysis program that is popularly used within the language development re-\\nsearch \\ufb01eld to obtain measures of language complexity and story cohesion ( MacWhinney & Snow,\\n1985 ). Children\\u2019s resulting narratives were scored on four dimensions: story grammar units, language\\ncomplexity, cohesion, and anaphora. Coders were naive to group assignment. Each dimension is de-\\nscribed in turn.\\nNarrative structure\\nNarratives were coded for story grammar units using the ENNI instructions ( Schneider et al., 2002 )\\nbut including two adaptations. First, a story grammar scoring scheme was created for the park stories\\nbased on the ENNI scheme for the pool series. Second, beginning and closing statements were scored\\nbecause these are traditionally included in story grammar analysis ( Stein & Glenn, 1979 ), although\\nthey are not included in the ENNI scoring scheme. Within this analysis, a formal beginning statement\\nrefers to the use of a clich\\u00e9 story opening such as \\u2018\\u2018Once upon a time\\u201d or \\u2018\\u2018One day.\\u201d An informal begin-\\nning statement refers to the use of an opening phrase that is not clich\\u00e9d but rather is set outside of the\\ntimeline of the current story such as \\u2018\\u2018Jack the bunny and Devin the dog had always been really good\\nfriends.\\u201d Similarly, a formal closing statement refers to a clich\\u00e9d ending such as \\u2018\\u2018The end\\u201d or \\u2018\\u2018And they\\nlived happily ever after,\\u201d whereas an informal closing statement refers to a phrase that is not clich\\u00e9d but\\nstill summarizes the story such as \\u2018\\u2018And they played together for the rest of the day.\\u201d Each formal\\nbeginning/closing statement was awarded 2 points, whereas each informal beginning/closing state-\\nment was awarded 1 point.\\nThe 12 story grammar units coded were formal beginning statement, informal beginning statement,\\ncharacter, setting, initiating event, internal response, internal plan, attempt, outcome, reaction of the char-\\nacter, formal closing statement, and informal closing statement . The units initiating event ,attempt , and\\noutcome were considered to be essential to the creation of a good story that is meant to convey a plot\\nand, thus, were given a score of 2, whereas the remaining units were given a score of 1. Total scores\\nfor the story grammar units per narrative were calculated, with the short single-episode storybooks\\nyielding a maximum score of 20 and the longer three-episode stories yielding a maximum score of 46.\\nA second subset score was computed for mental state references that included scores for internal re-\\nsponse and internal plan . Internal response story grammar units refer to an emotional or cognitive\\nreaction of a character to an event, whereas internal plan story grammar units refer to an explicit cog-\\nnition of a plan of action to deal with an initiating event such as \\u2018\\u2018He thought that he should jump in\\nthe pool to get the plane.\\u201d Children were awarded 1 point for each mention of a mental state\\nreference.\\nIntercoder reliability was assessed on 15% of narratives. Percentage agreement calculations were\\ndone such that the total number of times two researchers agreed on story grammar scores for one\\nstory was divided by the total possible story grammars per story. Of the 15% of narratives assessed,agreement rates between two independent researchers were 100% for the story grammar units setting ,\\ncharacters ,initiating event ,outcomes ,formal closing statement , and informal closing statement and were\\nbetween 80% and 99% for formal beginning statement ,informal beginning statement ,internal responses ,\\ninternal plans ,attempts , and reactions .\\nLanguage complexity\\nThe CLAN software was used to calculate the total number of words, total number of different\\nwords, number of utterances, mean length of utterances, and type token ratios (i.e., number of differ-\\nent words/total number of words). The ratio of different words to total words re\\ufb02ects the amount of\\nvaried language used and expresses the complexity of the children\\u2019s narrative language.R. Lever, M. S\\u00e9n\\u00e9chal / Journal of Experimental Child Psychology 108 (2011) 1\\u201324 7\\nContext\\nTo assess a child\\u2019s ability to appropriately contextualize a narrative, a measure of anaphora or\\ndecontextualized language referred to as \\u2018\\u2018\\ufb01rst mentions\\u201d was scored according to the instructions\\nof the ENNI ( Schneider et al., 2002 ). This analysis evaluates the appropriateness of referent expres-\\nsions that a child uses to introduce characters and objects when telling a story. Referring expressions\\nare linguistic forms used to refer to animate beings (e.g., the elephant ,Ella,she), objects (e.g., the train ,\\nit), places (e.g., the park ,there ), and concepts (e.g., an idea ). These expressions are considered to be ade-\\nquate if they are appropriate for the listener\\u2019s knowledge of the characters or objects. For example, a\\nspeci\\ufb01c inde\\ufb01nite noun phrase such as an elephant or a proper name is appropriate for the introduc-\\ntion of a character in a story, whereas the de\\ufb01nite article thepreceding elephant or the pronoun she\\nwould be appropriate only for a second or third mention of the character later in the story. Each men-\\ntion of the characters was scored with a 1, 2, or 3 according to how appropriate the phrase used was\\nfor its position in the narrative. For instance, if a character was introduced with the label he, the child\\nwas given 1 point; if a character was introduced with a de\\ufb01nite article such as the bunny , the child was\\nawarded 2 points; if a character was introduced using the appropriate label a bunny orJack, the child\\nwas awarded 3 points.\\nConnectives\\nThe frequency and types of connectives used were calculated with the CLAN software. There were\\nthree types of connectives that were coded (Peterson & McCabe, 1991): (a) independent connectives,\\nthat is, connectives that join together two independent clauses (e.g., and,now); (b) temporal connec-\\ntives, that is, connectives that provide knowledge about the sequence or chronology of the clauses\\n(e.g., then,later ,\\ufb01rst,next,as soon as ,while ); and (c) dependent clauses, that is, connectives that join\\nsecondary clauses that are dependent on the \\ufb01rst clause, thereby contributing to a more complex sen-\\ntence structure (e.g., but,or,because ,if,so).\\nReceptive vocabulary\\nThe Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test III (PPVT-III) ( Dunn & Dunn, 1997 ) was used as a measure of\\nchildren\\u2019s receptive vocabulary. Children were asked to select which of four alternative pictures, dis-\\nplayed in a grid, best represents the word spoken by the experimenter. This measure was used as a\\ncontrol variable to ensure that the intervention and the alternative treatment group did not differ\\non this aspect of language. It was not administered at posttest given that researchers have repeatedly\\nfound that dialogic reading interventions have little to no impact on this standardized test of receptive\\nvocabulary. In a meta-analysis on the effects of dialogic reading, Mol et al. (2008) reviewed 12 studies\\nthat used the PPVT-III as a posttest measure, and according to the presented con\\ufb01dence intervals in\\ntheir article, 11 of these studies could not signi\\ufb01cantly demonstrate effects of the intervention on\\nreceptive vocabulary.\\nExpressive vocabulary\\nA measure of expressive vocabulary was created to assess vocabulary learning given the well-\\ndocumented evidence that dialogic reading can enhance expressive vocabulary (e.g., Hargrave &\\nS\\u00e9n\\u00e9chal, 2000; S\\u00e9n\\u00e9chal, 1997 ). A total of 16 target words introduced and illustrated in the sto-\\nrybooks used were selected because they were assumed to be unknown to 5-year-olds: grocer ,\\nfawn ,carton ,pelican ,beret ,partridge ,telescope ,easel ,satchel ,fedora ,boulder ,maestro ,spatula ,ser-\\npent,caboose , and hen.A si n S\\u00e9n\\u00e9chal (1997) , these target words were unfamiliar words that rep-\\nresented familiar concepts to the children. For example, words such as satchel for bag and fedora\\nfor hat were used.\\nThe target words were tested by asking children to label line drawings of each target word. If chil-\\ndren produced synonyms for target words, the synonyms were noted and the children were asked\\nwhether they knew other names for those concepts. The use of picture line drawings was essential\\nto determining whether vocabulary learned could be generalized to other contexts than the books\\nin which they were introduced.8 R. Lever, M. S\\u00e9n\\u00e9chal / Journal of Experimental Child Psychology 108 (2011) 1\\u201324\\nDialogic reading intervention\\nBooks\\nFrom the 20 books comprising the Read Together ,Talk Together kit (Pearson Learning Group, 2006 ),\\neight books were selected. Read Together ,Talk Together is a dialogic reading kit that was designed on\\nthe research conducted by Whitehurst and colleagues ( Whitehurst, Arnold, et al., 1994; Whitehurst,\\nEpstein, et al., 1994; Whitehurst et al., 1988 ). It includes colorfully illustrated children\\u2019s books appro-\\npriate for the age level of 4 or 5 years. Of the books included in the kit, eight were chosen based on the\\nfollowing criteria. First, they included colorful illustrations that depicted the story to prevent complete\\nreliance on the text. Second, storybooks had obvious narrative plots following the typical initiating\\nevent\\u2013attempt\\u2013outcome chronology ( Stein & Glenn, 1979 ). Third, they were not alphabet books or\\nnon\\ufb01ction books that do not contain plots. Fourth, they were not holiday speci\\ufb01c (e.g., based on Christ-\\nmas events). The titles of the chosen books are presented in Appendix B.\\nThe kits for the books included pamphlets that detailed lists of dialogic questions that could be\\nasked during the reading of the books. From the lists provided, elaborative questions were selectedwith reference to Peterson and McCabe (2004) as the questions best related to the learning of narra-\\ntive knowledge. That is, the questions referred to plot, setting, evaluation of characters, and so on.\\nThese questions were used in addition to the spontaneous repetition, expansion, and recasting of chil-\\ndren\\u2019s oral contributions and any means of encouraging dialogue that may arise spontaneously. The\\nquestions were pasted on the appropriate pages of the books to ensure standardization and compli-\\nance to the dialogic reading method across interveners. Each book introduced two target words to\\nbe tested with the expressive vocabulary measure.\\nDialogic reading training\\nThree researchers were trained to administer the dialogic reading intervention during a 1-h group\\nsession. These interveners were \\ufb01rst shown a 15-min video provided by the Read Together ,Talk To-\\ngether kit depicting real-life examples of teachers using the dialogic reading prompts effectively. Next,\\na standard list of prompts used in this type of intervention were reviewed, and interveners partici-\\npated in role-playing scenarios to familiarize themselves with the techniques. The techniques learned\\nincluded questioning and giving feedback such as (a) asking \\u2018\\u2018wh-\\u201d questions (i.e., what, where, when,\\nwhy, who, which, and how questions), (b) following correct answers with expansions, (c) repeating\\nwhat the child says, (d) helping the child as needed, (e) praising and encouraging more interaction,\\nand (f) shadowing the child\\u2019s interest. The techniques require the adult to ask open-ended questions\\nand expand on the child\\u2019s comments, to encourage the child to produce multiword expressions and\\nlearn story structure, and to overall ensure the enjoyment of the child during storybook reading\\n(Whitehurst, Arnold, et al., 1994 ).\\nIn addition to using the elaborative questions included in each storybook, interveners were taught\\nto expand on the children\\u2019s responses in speci\\ufb01c ways to emphasize all four levels of narrative knowl-\\nedge. To emphasize plot structure, interveners were taught to sometimes highlight the entire plot ofthe story when expanding on the children\\u2019s responses. For example, if an intervener asked the ques-\\ntion \\u2018\\u2018What does Walter do after his dad leaves the room?\\u201d and the child responded with \\u2018\\u2018He jumps on\\nthe bed,\\u201d the intervener was encouraged to rephrase the answer in a manner such as \\u2018\\u2018That\\u2019s right,\\neven though Walter\\u2019s dad told him not to jump on the bed, he decided to jump on the bed as soon\\nas his dad left the room.\\u201d Similarly, to emphasize the importance of language complexity and descrip-\\ntion, interveners were asked to include adjectives in some of their responses. For example, using the\\nsame question, an intervener might rephrase the child\\u2019s response with \\u2018\\u2018That\\u2019s right, he excitedly\\njumps on the bed.\\u201d The inclusion of the adjective excitedly emphasizes the need to include descriptions\\nwithin the narrative storytelling. Cohesion-based expansions were provided by the interveners by\\nadding connectives to the children\\u2019s responses. For example, the intervener might have expanded\\non this response with \\u2018\\u2018That\\u2019s right, after Walter\\u2019s dad told him not to jump on the bed, he started\\njumping on the bed as soon as his dad left the room\\u201d to emphasize the importance of connector inclu-\\nsion within a narrative. Finally, context concepts might be emphasized within response expansions\\nwhen the experimenter clari\\ufb01es ambiguous concepts within a response. For example, the intervenerR. Lever, M. S\\u00e9n\\u00e9chal / Journal of Experimental Child Psychology 108 (2011) 1\\u201324 9\\nmight reply by replacing the ambiguous hepronoun with the name of the character such that the re-\\nsponse would now look like \\u2018\\u2018That\\u2019s right, Walter jumps on the bed.\\u201d\\nInterveners were also trained to emphasize the 16 target vocabulary words in the books. Interven-\\ners emphasized these words by giving the de\\ufb01nitions of the words and asking the children to repeat\\nthe correct vocabulary terms ( S\\u00e9n\\u00e9chal, 1997 ).\\nDialogic reading\\nEach intervener read dialogically with the same children in groups of one to four for two 20-min\\nsessions per week for 8 weeks. During each reading session, a single book was read, and over the\\ncourse of the intervention, each book was read twice to allow familiarity with the stories. The param-\\neters of the dialogic reading intervention were chosen to coincide with a concurrent intervention pro-\\ngram that was being administered; however, Hargrave and S\\u00e9n\\u00e9chal (2000) demonstrated that a\\ndialogic reading intervention could effectively improve children\\u2019s oral language skills, particularly\\ntheir expressive vocabulary skills, after 4 weeks of two dialogic reading sessions per week. Therefore,\\n8 weeks was predicted to be a more than suf\\ufb01cient time period to gain positive results from a similar\\nintervention of two sessions per week.\\nCompliance\\nObservations of each of the interveners were made during the intervention to con\\ufb01rm that the dia-\\nlogic reading techniques were properly administered. For each intervener\\u2019s 10th and 11th sessions, an\\nobserver visited the schools and unobtrusively documented key features of the interactions between\\nthe experimenter and the children in his or her assigned group. Observers looked for the involvement\\nof all children in the sessions, the various types of expansion feedback provided by the interveners to\\ncomplete the children\\u2019s responses, and positive encouragement. Finally, the interveners recorded in a\\nlogbook the date that each book was read, attendance, and any disruptive behaviors that occurred dur-\\ning a session.\\nAlternative treatment group\\nChildren in the alternative treatment group were participating in an early literacy study and re-\\nceived a researcher-developed 8-week phoneme awareness program. This was accomplished through\\nteaching the children how to analyze words into smaller sound segments. Children in this group were\\n\\ufb01rst taught to match pictures based on shared initial and \\ufb01nal sounds (\\ufb01ve words/session) such that\\neach child was given a sheet with a picture of the to-be-matched word along with three other words\\nand the children were asked to circle the pictures that started or ended the same. The children were\\nthen taught a phonemic segmenting task based on Elkonin (1973) \\u2018\\u2018Say It and Move It\\u201d activity. In this\\ntask, children learn to represent each sound within a word by stamping a marker, once for each pho-\\nneme in a word, into squares below a picture of that word.\\nProcedure\\nAt pretest, children were asked to complete the retelling narrative \\ufb01rst and the production narra-\\ntive task second on the short picture books. This was done to ensure optimal performance given the\\nevidence suggesting that the retelling of a previously heard narrative is easier than producing an ori-\\nginal novel narrative ( Hesketh, 2004 ). However, the order of the retelling and production tasks was\\ncounterbalanced on posttest because preliminary analysis of the pretest narratives did not indicate\\nany narrative task difference on pretest. Posttesting occurred during the 2 weeks immediately follow-\\ning the intervention and used the long versions of the picture books.\\nDuring the pretest, the assignment of the two ENNI books to the task was counterbalanced across\\nchildren. Half of the children in the dialogic reading condition were asked to retell the short pool story\\nand to produce a narrative for the short park book, and half were asked to retell the short park story\\nand to produce a novel narrative using the short pool book. The same was done for the alternative\\ntreatment children. This counterbalancing prevented bias on narrative scores based on one book plot10 R. Lever, M. S\\u00e9n\\u00e9chal / Journal of Experimental Child Psychology 108 (2011) 1\\u201324\\nversus another. Order of retelling and production tasks on posttest was counterbalanced within ses-\\nsions as well.\\nDuring the 8-week intervention, two sessions of dialogic reading were held each week in groups of\\ntwo to four children for 20 min. On occasion, absenteeism resulted in dialogic reading sessions con-\\nducted with only one child. However, for the majority of the 8 weeks, all children received the inter-\\nvention in groups of two or more. One book was read per session, and after all eight books were read\\nby the fourth week, they were repeated a second time in the same order. Children in all groups were\\nexposed to the same books. The alternative treatment children also received, in groups of two to four,\\ntheir intervention for 20 min twice a week.\\nResults\\nPreliminary analysis\\nPreliminary analyses of children\\u2019s receptive vocabulary were conducted using the PPVT-III ( Dunn &\\nDunn, 1997 ). No differences in receptive vocabulary scores were found between groups prior to inter-\\nvention ( p= .54). The mean PPVT-III standard scores were 94.86 ( SD= 14.11) for the dialogic reading\\nchildren and 97.47 ( SD= 12.63) for the alternative treatment children. PPVT-III scores were used as a\\ncovariate in subsequent analyses if these scores were related to child outcomes.\\nAlthough all children were tested on all measures, data loss resulted from technical errors with\\nmini-disk recorders during both pretest and posttest. As a result, three children per group were miss-\\ning narrative data on pretest, and another alternative treatment child was missing the retelling nar-\\nrative data on posttest. Given the repeated measures design of the study, all missing data were\\nreplaced using the maximum likelihood estimation as recommended when the amount of data miss-\\ning is large but other raw data from related variables were collected for participants ( McCartney, Bur-\\nchinal, & Bub, 2006 ). Estimated scores for missing data on pretest were based on the children\\u2019s own\\nscores on the PPVT-III and expressive vocabulary. On posttest, the scores for the one child missing\\nthe retelling task were predicted using the maximum likelihood estimation and were based on the\\nchild\\u2019s posttest production narrative scores due to the high correlations between production and\\nretelling narrative scores on posttest ( rs = .32\\u2013.88, p= .05). All means reported within the following\\nsections are calculated with data missing; however, inferential statistics are based on the entire sam-\\nple with missing scores replaced.\\nDependent measures were also analyzed for outliers. One dialogic reading child\\u2019s pretest narratives\\nwere signi\\ufb01cantly lower than those of all other children on story grammar units, thereby qualifying\\nhim as an outlier. However, both of his posttest narratives received scores within 2.58 standard devi-\\nations of the mean ( Tabachnick & Fidell, 2007 ) and were actually higher than some other participants\\u2019\\nnarratives. Therefore, despite variability within groups, no participants were removed based on outlier\\ncriteria.\\nPretest analyses\\nChildren\\u2019s pretest scores on all dependent measures were analyzed with univariate between-par-\\nticipants analyses of variance (ANOVAs) to ensure no group differences prior to intervention on either\\nproduction or retelling narratives. Results revealed no signi\\ufb01cant differences ( ps = .102\\u2013.875) between\\ngroups on measures of structure, language complexity, context, and cohesion on pretest despite super-\\n\\ufb01cial differences in the pretest mean scores that suggested possibly higher scores in the alternative\\ntreatment group as compared with the dialogic reading group (see Table 1 ).\\nPosttest analyses\\nDescriptive statistics for each group for story structure, language complexity, context knowledge,\\nand cohesion (i.e., use of connectives) as a function of narrative tasks are provided in Table 2 . One-\\ntailed analyses of covariance (ANCOVAs) with treatment group as a between-participants factor andR. Lever, M.

One-tailed statistical tests were used because there were no the-\\noretical or empirical reasons to predict that the phonological awareness intervention that was used as\\nthe alternative treatment would affect narrative knowledge signi\\ufb01cantly.\\nTo illustrate group differences in narrative performance, a typical narrative for children in each\\ngroup is presented in Appendix C.

The production narratives for each child\\nfrom the different treatment groups are discussed because they best demonstrate the effects of the\\nintervention.\\nIntervention effects on story grammar units\\nThe presence of story grammar units in the children\\u2019s narratives was used as a measure of story\\nplot structure. For the production task, children\\u2019s PPVT-III raw scores in addition to pretest story gram-\\nmar total scores were used as covariates due to a signi\\ufb01cant correlation between children\\u2019s receptive\\nvocabulary and narrative structure scores on the production task ( r= .39, p= .014). As predicted, the\\ndialogic reading children had signi\\ufb01cantly higher total story grammar scores than the alternative\\ntreatment group on the production task, F(1, 36) = 5.49, p= .001, d= .38, and the retelling task,\\nF(1, 37) = 3.67, p= .032, d= .28, after controlling for the pretest total story grammar unit scores. In par-\\nticular, the children who received the intervention seemed to include more character mentions, initi-\\nating events ,reactions ,internal responses , and internal plans in both the production and retelling stories\\nthan the children in the control group.\\nTo allow comparisons with previous research ( Zevenbergen et al., 2003 ), follow-up analyses exam-\\nined whether story grammar units that referred to mental states, namely internal responses and inter-\\nnal plans , were improved by the dialogic reading intervention. ANCOVAs for pretest scores revealed\\nthat the dialogic reading children provided signi\\ufb01cantly more internal thought and feeling references\\nin their production narratives, F(1, 36) = 2.85, p= .050, d= .56, as well as in their retelling narratives,\\nF(1, 37) = 6.25, p= .009, d= .77, than alternative treatment children. Given these results, two addi-\\ntional tests were conducted on the remaining story grammar units (the story grammar scores minus\\nthe scores for internal responses and internal plans ) to assess whether the bene\\ufb01ts of dialogic reading\\nwere limited to mental state referents. Using PPVT-III and pretest scores as covariates, the analyses\\nshowed that the dialogic reading children still provided signi\\ufb01cantly more structure to their produc-\\ntion narratives than the alternative treatment children, F(1, 36) = 4.75, p= .018, d= .32, but the effect\\non the retelling posttest was no longer signi\\ufb01cant, F(1, 37) = 2.14, p= .153.\\nIn general, the dialogic reading children included more structure components in their production\\nnarratives than the alternative treatment children. Furthermore, the dialogic reading children men-\\ntioned internal thoughts and emotions more than the alternative treatment children on both the\\nretelling and production tasks. The following excerpt from an alternative treatment child\\u2019s posttest\\nproduction narrative (whole text provided in Appendix B) demonstrates how this group in general de-\\nscribed events that were not chronologically structured or explained through the character\\u2019s internal\\nthoughts or goals:\\nHe had a lot of balloons. Then he said, \\u2018\\u2018Can I have one balloon?\\u201d Then he said, \\u2018\\u2018No.\\u201d Then he said,\\n\\u2018\\u2018No no.\\u201d Then he said, \\u2018\\u2018Okay.\\u201d And then the bunny\\u2019s walking. And then the other bunny was there.\\nAnd the other bunny\\u2019s walking. Then he said, \\u2018\\u2018He didn\\u2019t let me get a balloon.\\u201d Then he said, \\u2018\\u2018Oh\\n\\ufb01rst give the money to him.\\u201d Then they got two balloons.\\nIn the above excerpt, the child was narrating pictures that depicted a character whose attempt to\\npurchase a balloon from a vendor was interrupted because he had no money, so he needed to ask an-\\nother adult to pay for the balloon. However, this logical sequence of events was not decipherable from\\nthe child\\u2019s production. First, she did not explicitly state several key events that are important to the\\ncomprehension of the story such as the main character\\u2019s discovery that he has no money and the adult\\ncharacter providing the money to purchase the balloon. In addition, even the implied events did not\\nappear to be chronological. The narrator\\u2019s failure to properly distinguish the characters or any events\\noutside of the dialogue made it appear that the outcome of the child\\u2019s attempt to buy a balloon is that\\nthe vender \\ufb01rst said \\u2018\\u2018no\\u201d but then said \\u2018\\u2018yes.\\u201d However, shortly after, it was apparent that the maincharacter did not yet get a balloon. Thus, the outcome of the vendor saying \\u2018\\u2018yes\\u201d to a balloon request\\nappeared to have been provided in the middle of the story as opposed to its logical sequential place at\\nthe end. In addition, the child did not explicitly state the character\\u2019s internal motivation for asking for\\na balloon, resulting in the actions seeming random and unexplained.\\nAlternatively, the following excerpt from a dialogic reading child\\u2019s production narrative included\\nmore structural components:R. Lever, M. S\\u00e9n\\u00e9chal / Journal of Experimental Child Psychology 108 (2011) 1\\u201324 13\\nHe saw someone holding balloons from the stash. He wanted one. Then he asked to the man if he\\ncould have one of the red balloons. And he looked on the ground. The man told him \\ufb01ve dollars. He\\nlooked in his pocket. He did not see any. He just got one. And the man said, \\u2018\\u2018Only one red balloon.\\nOnly if you have \\ufb01ve dollars.\\u201d The lady got \\ufb01ve dollars in her little purse and gave it to the man.\\nThen both of the little girl and the little boy has two balloons that were the same color.\\nClearly, all of the events were explicitly stated in this story, including the main character\\u2019s failure to\\n\\ufb01nd money in his pockets. Also, all of the events occurred in logical order such that the overall out-\\ncome of getting the balloons remains at the end of the story. Finally, the dialogic reading child pro-\\nvided more internal motivation details than the alternative treatment child, stating that the main\\ncharacter asked for a balloon because he wanted one.\\nThese two examples illustrate nicely the structural differences in the two production narratives as\\na function of treatment groups. As can be expected, the dialogic reading child\\u2019s entire posttest narra-\\ntive in Appendix B obtained a higher story grammar unit score of 28 of 46, whereas the alternative\\ntreatment child obtained a lower score of 18 of 46.\\nIntervention effects on language complexity\\nThe number of words in the story, the type token ratio, and mean length of utterances were ana-\\nlyzed as measures of language complexity. Pretest scores were used as covariates for all ANCOVAs.\\nContrary to expectations, no signi\\ufb01cant differences were found between groups on any of the language\\ncomplexity measure analyses, with ps ranging from .28 to .97.\\nThe lack of signi\\ufb01cant group differences in language complexity was evident in the example nar-\\nratives. The excerpts below demonstrate that the stories were constructed mainly with short utter-\\nances containing similar noun and verb phrases but lacking descriptive detail:\\nAlternative treatment child: Then he was holding on. Then it \\ufb02ew away. Then there was a string\\npiece.\\nDialogic reading child: She had a balloon. She saw someone come. They said, \\u2018\\u2018Hi.\\u201d And the little girl\\nsaid, \\u2018\\u2018Hi.\\u201d\\nThese short utterances did not actually differ greatly for the children in the two groups. Therefore,\\nalthough the dialogic reading child\\u2019s narratives appeared to be more advanced than the alternative\\ntreatment child\\u2019s narratives, this difference was not due to a richer variety of language or a longer\\nword count.\\nIntervention effects on contextual knowledge\\nNarratives were scored for proper introduction of all \\ufb01rst mentions of characters and objects as an\\nindex of anaphora. During the production task, the dialogic reading children provided references to per-\\nsons and objects that used decontextualized language more appropriately than those provided by the\\nalternative treatment children after controlling for the pretest scores and PPVT-III, F(1, 36) = 3.63,\\np= .032, one-tailed, d= .32. No signi\\ufb01cant difference between groups on anaphora was found on the\\nretelling posttest, F(1, 37) < 1, p= .27.\\nAgain, when analyzing the production narrative of the alternative treatment child, it was evident\\nthat failure to use decontextualized language appropriately was partially responsible for the incom-\\nprehensibility of the text. Noticeably, in this excerpt of a dialogue among several characters (entire\\nnarrative presented in Appendix B), the alternative treatment child continuously referred to all char-\\nacters involved in the conversation as he:\\nHe had a lot of balloons. Then he said, \\u2018\\u2018Can I have one balloon?\\u201d Then he said, \\u2018\\u2018No.\\u201d Then he said,\\n\\u2018\\u2018No no.\\u201d Then he said, \\u2018\\u2018Okay.\\u201d\\nWithout the context of the storybook, the child\\u2019s reference to hethroughout this conversation re-\\nmained unexplained. Who is he? Is the same character responding to himself? Furthermore, although\\nthe alternative treatment child refers to the main character as the doggie at the beginning of the nar-\\nrative, which would normally suf\\ufb01ce as an anaphoric reference to another character (although the\\nshould be replaced by aon the \\ufb01rst introduction), the failure to actually reference this character again14 R. Lever, M. S\\u00e9n\\u00e9chal / Journal of Experimental Child Psychology 108 (2011) 1\\u201324\\nleads one to question whether there actually was a second main character at all. The alternative treat-\\nment child seemed to properly reference the \\ufb01rst mention of objects, with a balloon and two balloons ,\\nbut she did not properly reference the other two characters, stating only the person and the other bunny\\nas if these characters had already been mentioned.\\nThe dialogic reading child, on the other hand, referenced all characters and the main objects of the\\nstory properly, leading to a better contextualized, more coherent story, as demonstrated by the follow-\\ning excerpt:\\nThere was a little girl that has a wagon. She had a balloon. She saw someone come. They said, \\u2018\\u2018Hi.\\u201d\\nAnd the little girl said, \\u2018\\u2018Hi.\\u201d\\nAll participants in this dialogue were clearly identi\\ufb01ed; thus, the conversation was easily\\nunderstood.\\nIntervention effects on cohesion\\nChildren\\u2019s use of connectives such as and,but, and orduring storytelling was used to index story\\ncohesion; in particular, the variety of connectives used within the story was examined as measured\\nby the number of different connectives used. No signi\\ufb01cant differences in the number of different con-\\nnectives used were found between groups on posttest either on the production narrative, F(1, 36) < 1,\\np= .73, or on the retelling narrative, F(1, 37) < 1, p= .89. Both example children demonstrated the\\nproper uses of the independent connective and(to join two independent but related phrases together)\\nor the temporal connective then (to provide a chronological reference of events), as demonstrated\\nwhen the alternative treatment child provided the utterance and then the bunny\\u2019s walking and when\\nthe dialogic reading child provided the utterance and then the little girl\\u2019s still mad. However, both chil-\\ndren did not typically use other connectives. Clearly, the groups did not differ signi\\ufb01cantly on a variety\\nof connectives used. It is possible that children in this sample had not yet learned the proper use of\\nconnectives in general. Alternatively, it is possible that although the children did indeed know how\\nto use complex connectives, they did not use them for this particular task.\\nTreatment \\ufb01delity\\nTo ensure that the intervention was administered as intended, several analyses were performed to\\nassess treatment \\ufb01delity, including the number of intervention sessions attended, the replication of\\npreviously found effects of dialogic reading on expressive vocabulary, and observations of dialogic\\nreading sessions.\\nAttendance\\nAttendance was measured to ensure that all children were receiving enough intervention sessions\\nto assume that any learning occurred as a direct result of dialogic reading. The mean numbers of ses-\\nsions attended were 14.1 ( SD= 1.6) of 16 for the dialogic reading group and 15.1 ( SD= 0.8) of 16 for the\\nalternative treatment group. In both groups, the child who received the fewest number of sessions at-\\ntended 12 sessions. Because every child received at least 75% of the intervention sessions, any\\nimprovement in narrative skills found over and above improvements in the alternative treatment\\ngroup could be assumed to have resulted from the dialogic reading method.\\nIntervention effects on expressive vocabulary\\nPrevious research found that dialogic reading sessions signi\\ufb01cantly enhance children\\u2019s expressive\\nvocabulary (see meta-analysis by Mol et al., 2008 ). A group by testing time repeated measures ANOVA\\nrevealed a Testing Time /C2Group interaction, F(1, 39) = 7.16, p= .001, with an effect size of d= .66. On\\nposttest, the dialogic reading children correctly named, on average, more than 2 of 16 words ( M= 2.42,\\nSD= 1.94), whereas the alternative treatment children provided fewer than 2 of 16 words ( M= 1.37,\\nSD= 0.83), t(1, 38) = \\u20132.21, p= .034. No group differences on expressive vocabulary were found on pre-\\ntest, with means of 1.00 and 0.95 ( SDs = 0.71 and 0.62) for the dialogic reading and alternative treat-\\nment children, respectively.R. Lever, M. S\\u00e9n\\u00e9chal / Journal of Experimental Child Psychology 108 (2011) 1\\u201324 15\\nObservations of dialogic reading sessions\\nThree interveners were responsible for conducting intervention sessions with the children. As such,\\nobservations of two sessions per intervener were scored to ensure similarity of treatments provided.\\nMean scores of the two observations per intervener were analyzed, and results indicated that each\\nchild was providing at least one response to an elaborative question per session and that each child\\naveraged between six and seven responses to questions per session. All three interveners provided\\npraise to the children\\u2019s responses between 78% and 94% of the time. Furthermore, all three interveners\\nexpanded on at least 47% of the children\\u2019s responses and used each one of the four types of expansions\\nat least once per session. In general, interveners used context expansions most often (47\\u201375% of the\\nexpansions observed during the six sessions referenced the characters and objects discussed in spe-\\nci\\ufb01c unambiguous terms) and cohesion expansions least often (18\\u201335% of the 46 expansions observed\\nincluded connectives).\\nAlthough interveners did differ somewhat in their typical elaborations of children\\u2019s responses,\\nthese differences had no signi\\ufb01cant effect on the results of the study. To verify this, between-partic-\\nipants ANOVAs were conducted on dependent measures using intervener as the independent variable.None of these ANOVAs was signi\\ufb01cant. Furthermore, although conversations about the stories may\\nhave differed somewhat, it is important to remember that all questions meant to prompt dialogue\\nwere standardized by including them directly in the text of the storybook. Given the similarities in\\nthe dialogic reading sessions for the intervention groups, the previously presented group differences\\nare considered to be valid effects of the intervention treatment.\\nDisruptive behaviors\\nFully 88% of the children experienced fewer than four sessions during which they or another child\\nin their group engaged in disruptive behaviors. In most cases, the disruptions were inattentiveness\\nthat could be resolved by calling the children\\u2019s attention back to the activity. The number of disrup-\\ntions was not associated with any of the dependent variables except the mean length of utterances\\n(r= .32, p= .05). In this case, the frequency of disruptive behaviors was covaried out of the analysis;\\nhowever, covarying this variable out of the equation did not impact the results.\\nNarrative tasks: Production versus retelling\\nGiven the extant research on narrative knowledge (e.g., Merritt & Liles, 1989; Nelson, 2007 ), addi-\\ntional analyses were conducted to investigate further differences in children\\u2019s performance on produc-\\ntion and retelling tasks. These analyses were collapsed across treatment groups and conducted on the\\nlonger posttest stories. Children\\u2019s posttest performance on story grammar units did differ signi\\ufb01cantly\\nbased on narrative task at posttest, t(1, 39) = /C01.78, p= .042. As indicated in Table 3 , children included\\nsigni\\ufb01cantly more story grammar units for the retelling narratives than for the production narratives.\\nIn fact, they included signi\\ufb01cantly more mental state references on the retelling task than on the pro-\\nduction task, t(1, 39) = /C03.17, p= .002. In addition, children used more words in total on the retelling\\ntask than on the production task at posttest, t(1, 39) = /C01.87, p= .035, and used more contextualized\\nreferences on the retelling task at posttest than on the production task at posttest, t(1, 39) = \\u20132.64,\\np= .012. No other signi\\ufb01cant differences were found.\\nDiscussion\\nOral narrative skills are considered to be essential to young children\\u2019s social communication ( Don-\\nald, 1991 ) and their ability to comprehend and organize event knowledge ( Nelson, 2007 ). Moreover,\\nautobiographical oral narrative skills are assumed to develop in the context of parent\\u2013child conversa-\\ntions ( Peterson et al., 1999 ). The goal of the current study was to test whether adult\\u2013child conversa-\\ntions while reading storybooks would enhance \\ufb01ctional narrative skills. The main hypothesis was that\\nthe biweekly elaborative dialogic reading intervention conducted in small groups over 8 weeks would\\nsigni\\ufb01cantly improve the structure, linguistic complexity, and decontextualized and cohesive nature\\nof children\\u2019s \\ufb01ctional narratives. Our results support the notion that some, but not all, dimensions16 R. Lever, M. S\\u00e9n\\u00e9chal / Journal of Experimental Child Psychology 108 (2011) 1\\u201324\\nof narrative skills are sensitive to dialogic discourse during shared reading. More speci\\ufb01cally, dialogic\\nreading children produced narratives that were better structured and more appropriately decontextu-\\nalized than children who were in the alternative treatment group. The dialogic reading children\\u2019s\\nretelling narratives also included more references to mental states and emotions than the alternative\\ntreatment children\\u2019s retelling narratives, although these structural differences did not extend to other\\nstory grammar units. Contrary to expectations, however, dialogic reading did not affect the complexity\\nof language within the children\\u2019s narratives or their inclusion of cohesive ties. Replicating well-estab-\\nlished \\ufb01ndings ( Mol et al., 2008 ), expressive vocabulary gains were found.\\nThe most important \\ufb01nding of the current study is that interactive shared reading sessions signif-\\nicantly increased children\\u2019s inclusion of structural components in their production and retelling of \\ufb01c-\\ntional narratives. Arguably, the inclusion of a logical structure is considered to be the most important\\ncomponent of a narrative because it allows conveyance of the meaning and plot of the story ( Mandler,\\n1984 ). If one argues that the inclusion of story grammar units is based on schematic information ex-\\ntracted from previous experiences, one could argue that 5-year-olds\\u2019 narrative schemas are incom-\\nplete. Typically developing 5-year-olds can include setting references, initiating events ,attempts , and\\nsometimes outcomes in their constructed narratives, but they do not spontaneously include mentions\\nofinternal responses ,internal plans , and reactions before 8 years of age ( Stein & Glenn, 1979 ). However,\\nafter 8 weeks of dialogic interactions during shared reading, children were able to produce narratives\\nthat included character name mentions, initiating events ,internal responses ,internal plans , and reac-\\ntions , whereas the alternative treatment children did not show this improvement. Therefore, interact-\\ning dialogically in storybook sessions promoted more elaborate story schemas that include internal\\nresponses ,internal plans , and reactions .\\nThere are two reasons why the nature of dialogic reading might bene\\ufb01t this key element of story\\nknowledge above all others. First, the elaborative conversations and questions about stories occur\\nwithin the context of a storybook. These storybooks in the current study were chosen based on the\\nclarity of the plot and demonstration of the plot in the pictures. As such, children were listening to\\na plotted story and answering questions about the story plot while perceiving pictures that demon-\\nstrate plot. Therefore, the context of the picture book reinforced the children\\u2019s awareness of plot ele-\\nments, resulting in this type of intervention highlighting structural knowledge. Second, dialogic\\nreading could impact narrative structure above other dimensions due to the nature of the questions\\nasked to maintain dialogue. Most elaborative questions asked were about speci\\ufb01c events in the stories\\nand, therefore, might highlight the plot despite the attempt to speci\\ufb01cally paste questions in the sto-\\nrybooks that reference all areas of narrative knowledge equally. For example, questions such as \\u2018\\u2018What\\ncolor is Spike after he is splashed by the car?\\u201d were meant to ensure that children acknowledge theTable 3\\nPosttest mean scores and standard deviations on narrative dependent measures as a function of narrative tasks.\\nProduction Retelling\\nVariable MS D MS D\\nStructure\\nStory grammar unit total raw scorea25.43c7.34 26.8c6.16\\nMental state referencesb1.30c1.04 2.00c1.30\\nLanguage complexity\\nNumber of words 187.35c96.86 207.13c100.73\\nType token ratio 0.40 0.09 0.41 0.11Mean length of utterances 6.32 1.30 6.07 1.28\\nContext\\nAnaphora 12.95\\nc1.66 4.05c1.62\\nCohesion\\nConnectives 3.73 3.40 14.23 3.30\\nNote.

However, it is evident that this question was, \\ufb01rst and foremost, related to\\nplot components because it reinforced acknowledgment of an initiating event (a car splashes Spike)\\nand an outcome (Spike is now covered in mud).\\nAlthough story structure improvement was the strongest \\ufb01nding of the current study, another sig-\\nni\\ufb01cant bene\\ufb01t of dialogic reading is improved anaphoric references. Children who received the dia-\\nlogic reading sessions showed a signi\\ufb01cantly better ability to properly contextualize \\ufb01rst mentions of\\ncharacters and objects in their production and retelling narratives, indicating that dialogic reading\\nchildren learned contextual knowledge from the shared reading sessions. Observations of intervention\\nadministration shed light on why this type of intervention might promote contextual knowledge.\\nThese observations, conducted to ensure treatment \\ufb01delity, revealed that when children used an\\nambiguous reference of heorit, the intervener rephrased the response with a more contextualized ref-\\nerence such as a character name or an object label. For example, if the child said, \\u2018\\u2018He is jumping on the\\nbed,\\u201d the intervener would rephrase the statement as \\u2018\\u2018Corduroy is jumping on the bed.\\u201d Because this\\ntype of expansion was the most frequent during the sessions, the dialogic reading children would have\\nhad their ambiguous references \\u2018\\u2018corrected\\u201d often and, therefore, would have been exposed to theimportance of contextual knowledge.\\nOverall, the main \\ufb01nding of this study was that the narrative elements relating to story comprehen-\\nsion were the aspects that were signi\\ufb01cantly affected by dialogic reading. That is, it is necessary for a\\nstory to be chronologically structured and appropriately decontextualized for it to be easily compre-\\nhended. A 5-year-old\\u2019s limited working memory may provide a theoretical explanation for why these\\nelements would be improved \\ufb01rst. Kindergartners might not have the processing capacity that would\\nallow them to attend to all of the components of the story that is read aloud and may be using the\\nmajority of their working memory in an attempt to comprehend the plot of the story, resulting in their\\nattending less to the variety of words and connective ties used (Case, 1991). For this reason, a child\\nmay be attending to story structure and anaphora given that story grammars are considered to be di-\\nrectly related to story comprehension ( Mandler, 1984 ) and decontextualized references aid in action\\nattribution ( Cain, 2003 ). That is, children categorize plot elements into story grammar variables, such\\nas events and outcomes, and can understand the story itself more quickly ( Haberlandt, Berian, & Sand-\\nson, 1980 ). These events and outcomes can be understood only if the characters are clearly distin-\\nguished ( Cain, 2003 ). Because children are attending to structure and anaphora to comprehend the\\nstories themselves, it is logical that they would gain knowledge of how to use these elements \\ufb01rst\\nin the construction of their own stories.\\nAlthough not many studies have investigated the effect of dialogic reading on narrative skills, many\\nhave con\\ufb01rmed that dialogic reading improves children\\u2019s expressive vocabulary ( Mol et al., 2008 ). The\\ncurrent study also found signi\\ufb01cant gains on the expressive measure of book vocabulary. This replica-\\ntion of vocabulary results proves that (a) dialogic reading affects language skills other than narrative\\nability and (b) the study is comparable to past research, suggesting that the intervention itself was\\nconducted in a similar fashion to previous studies.\\nAnother contribution of the current study was the comparison of children\\u2019s performance on narra-\\ntive production and retelling tasks. All children in the sample retold narratives that were signi\\ufb01cantly\\nlonger, were better structured, contained more mental state references, and were signi\\ufb01cantly better\\ndecontextualized than their production narratives. There are several possible explanations for these\\n\\ufb01ndings. The two tasks may have had different performance demands, and the retelling task may have\\nbeen easier than the production task ( Merritt & Liles, 1989 ). When asked to produce a story from a\\npicture book, the number of possible options for story production may have exceeded children\\u2019s work-\\ning memory and hindered their ability to construct narratives that included suf\\ufb01cient elements of all\\ncomponents of narrative knowledge. On the other hand, during the retelling task, children were able\\nto parse from the told story what they thought were the most important structural elements from thepreviously presented script and to reiterate them back to the examiner. Therefore, the retelling tasks\\nmay be easier. This explanation agrees with other comparisons of the production and retelling narra-\\ntive task genres in the literature ( Coelho, 2002; Merritt & Liles, 1989; Trautman, Healey, Brown,\\nBrown, & Jermano, 1999 ).\\nHowever, another more theoretical explanation for these task differences is that children might be\\nshowing competence differences at constructing narratives. That is, the task of producing a story18 R. Lever, M. S\\u00e9n\\u00e9chal / Journal of Experimental Child Psychology 108 (2011) 1\\u201324\\nwithout guidance and the task of retelling one heard previously may require the use of different cog-\\nnitive skills ( Nelson, 2007 ). It is possible that retelling a previously told narrative is more of a story\\ncomprehension task than a construction task ( Mandler, 1984 ). If the retelling task is related to com-\\nprehension, it is possible that simply being able to comprehend the important elements of a story im-\\nproves scores on this task. Most likely, children develop the ability to comprehend what makes a story\\ngood earlier than they are aware of how to construct a good quality \\ufb01ctional narrative ( Nelson, 2007 ),\\nand 5-year-olds do not generalize this knowledge to production tasks. Therefore, when a child is com-\\npleting a retelling task, the child\\u2019s comprehension of what elements of the story are important would\\nallow him or her to retell the narrative with details that include character motivations and evaluative\\ndetail. However, when a child is completing a production narrative, the child\\u2019s schema for construct-\\ning a \\ufb01ctional narrative from scratch might not yet include elements such as characters thoughts and\\nmay be limited to only plot details. For example, Trautman et al. (1999) found that emotional or men-\\ntal state references are not as common in novel \\ufb01ctional narratives as they are in retellings of previ-\\nously heard stories. Because Trautman and colleagues were referring to older children (6\\u201312 years of\\nage), this provides evidence that the 5-year-olds in the current study may be too young to refer fre-quently to mental states within their \\ufb01ctional stories.\\nInterestingly, this theoretical explanation is consistent with the \\ufb01ndings of a correlational study\\nthat found links between oral narrative constructions and later literacy skills ( Grif\\ufb01n et al., 2004 ).\\nThe produced narratives of 5-year-olds were correlated with the written narrative productions and\\nreading comprehension scores of the same children at 8 years of age, but the written productions\\nof 8-year-olds were not related to their concurrent reading comprehension scores. Most interesting,\\ncertain components of the oral productions were differentially related to written production and read-\\ning comprehension. Speci\\ufb01cally, the inclusion of character mental state references in oral narratives at\\n5 years of age was related to reading comprehension at 8 years of age, whereas the inclusion of plot\\nand structural elements at 5 years of age was related to written narrative productions. This pattern of\\n\\ufb01ndings may shed light on the \\ufb01ndings of the current study. If one agrees that story retelling is more\\nclosely a story comprehension task, it is not surprising that it is the inclusion of mental state refer-\\nences that was most affected by dialogic reading for this task. Similarly, if narrative production tasks\\nrequire the activation of readily available story schemas, it is not surprising that it is the overall inclu-\\nsion of structural elements that was improved by dialogic reading.\\nSome limitations of the current study are noteworthy. For one, the effect of dialogic reading on nar-\\nrative skills was modest, with effect sizes ranging from d= .28 to d= .77. Clearly, larger effect sizes\\nwould be bene\\ufb01cial. The failure to \\ufb01nd larger effect sizes likely is due to the amount of variability\\nof children\\u2019s narrative skills represented in this sample. This variability may be due to the variety\\nin socioeconomic backgrounds of the participating children. Tighter controls and less variability in\\ngroups might raise effect sizes. Furthermore, increasing the length or frequency of sessions might also\\nraise effect sizes given that sessions held twice a week for 8 weeks might not be enough for children to\\nfully internalize their new knowledge about narratives.\\nAnother limitation to this study is that it does not allow us to integrate the research on children\\u2019s\\nknowledge of autobiographical and \\ufb01ctional narratives. The \\ufb01ndings obtained suggest that change in\\nnarrative knowledge can occur in a relatively short period of time, but intervention research on auto-\\nbiographical narratives with low-SES children would suggest that changes in narrative knowledge do\\nnot occur as quickly ( Peterson et al., 1999 ). Whether autobiographical narrative knowledge and \\ufb01c-\\ntional narrative knowledge are acquired at the same rate, whether they are in\\ufb02uenced by the same\\ntypes of interactions, and whether \\ufb01ctional narrative knowledge builds on children\\u2019s already devel-\\noped autobiographical narrative knowledge are critical questions that will need to be addressed in fu-\\nture research. The very limited and preliminary research suggests that there may be fundamental\\ndifferences between the two types of knowledge. S\\u00e9n\\u00e9chal et al. (2008) did not \\ufb01nd a relation between\\nchildren\\u2019s performance on an autobiographical story task and a \\ufb01ctional story task based on a wordless\\nbook prompt. Future studies are necessary to investigate whether children\\u2019s ability to tell autobio-\\ngraphical stories and \\ufb01ctional stories re\\ufb02ects an overarching story schema.\\nYoung children gain narrative construction knowledge from elaborative event conversations with\\nlearned adults ( Peterson et al., 1999 ). However, most research on this topic has focused on event\\nconversations that reference personal memories experienced by either adults or children. AlthoughR. Lever, M. S\\u00e9n\\u00e9chal / Journal of Experimental Child Psychology 108 (2011) 1\\u201324 19\\nnarrative construction knowledge has previously been linked to reading and storybook experience\\nthrough correlational research ( Grif\\ufb01n et al., 2004; O\\u2019Neill et al., 2004 ), few studies have demonstrated\\nthat oral \\ufb01ctional storytelling skills could be improved by shared reading experiences. By expanding\\nthe current literature on dialogic reading and narratives ( Zevenbergen et al., 2003 ), the current re-\\nsearch contributes to the \\ufb01eld by demonstrating that elaborative story conversations in the context\\nof storybooks can improve children\\u2019s \\ufb01ctional oral story construction.\\nAppendix A.

Dialogic reading, preschool, community health centers,\\nshared book reading, video training\\nINTRODUCTION\\nShared book reading is a way that children can acquire important\\npre-reading skills, including vocabulary knowledge, awareness of print,\\nand story structures (Snow, Burns, & Griffin, 1998). By engaging chil-dren in shared book reading, families can play a critical role in prepar-\\ning children to learn to read. Dialogic reading (DR) is an evidence-\\nbased approach to shared book reading that has been described andextensively documented by Whitehurst and colleagues (e.g., Arnold,\\nLonigan, Whitehurst, & Epstein, 1994; Lonigan & Whitehurst, 1998;\\nWhitehurst, Arnold et al., 1994a; Whitehurst, Epstein et al., 1994;Whitehurst et al., 1988, 1999). The main goal of dialogic reading is forthe child to become the storyteller and for the adult to facilitate, expand\\nand respond to the child\\u2019s verbalizations. DR involves strategies to\\nengage a child actively during story time so he/she can practice usinglanguage and receive adult feedback. Research by Whitehurst and hiscolleagues clearly demonstrates that these adult-child interactions in the\\ncontext of picture book reading facilitate young children\\u2019s language\\ndevelopment. For a comprehensive review of the DR literature and adescription of the facilitating strategies, readers are directed to Zeven -\\nbergen and Whitehurst (2003). Types and definitions of DR strategiesare also provided in Appendix.118 JOURNAL OF APPLIED SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGY\\nVideo-Based Instruction of DR Strategies\\nStudies by Whitehurst and colleagues (Whitehurst, 1991; Whitehurst\\net al., 1994a,b) provide evidence for the benefits of DR on expressive\\nlanguage in preschoolers and emergent literacy skills at the end of kinder -\\ngarten. Recently, Whitehurst collaborated with Pearson Early Learning\\npublishing company to develop a video-based training program designed\\nto teach adults to use DR strategies. Read Together, Talk Together\\n(RTTT ; Pearson Early Learning, 2002) is a commercially available,\\n15-minute video-based instructional program for parents and teachers.\\nThere are several advantages for using a video-based training pro -\\ngram to teach parents to use DR strategies. First, the purpose of thevideo is to teach or encourage skills that the parent may or may not have\\nin his/her repertoire. Based on observational learning theory (Bandura,\\n1986), parents and teachers may learn DR strategies better if they canview other people similar to themselves modeling the target behavior(Zevenbergen & Whitehurst, 2003). Additional advantages to using a\\nvideo to train parents in DR procedures include cost efficiency, trainer\\ntime efficiency, and consistency in intervention delivery (Blom-Hoff-man et al., in press). These key factors are helpful in facilitating the dis-\\nsemination of DR strategies to families with children at risk for reading\\ndifficulties.\\nVideo-Based Parent Training\\nVideo-based instructions have been used to teach a variety of skills to\\nparents. Webster-Stratton conducted a series of studies (1981a,b; 1982)\\nin which she developed and evaluated the use of a group-based parent\\ntraining program that included videotaped vignettes and a discussionformat. These initial studies were conducted with well-educated and non-\\nclinical samples. Subsequently, Webster-Stratton (1984) conducted a\\nstudy that investigated the short- and long-term effectiveness of this\\nvideo-based training compared with individualized therapy that usedfeedback, rehearsal, and live modeling, and an untreated control groupwith low-income parents of children with clinically significant behavior\\nchallenges. At immediate posttest assessment, parents in both treatment\\ngroups showed significant improvements in attitudes and behaviorwhen compared with parents in an untreated control group. Children in\\nboth treatment groups showed a decrease in deviant and non-compliant\\nbehavior; however, such changes did not reach significance. At the1-year follow-up, attitudinal and behavioral changes in parents andBlom-Hoffman et al. 119\\nchildren were maintained in both treatment groups. Moreover, although\\nchanges in child\\u2019s non-compliance and deviant behavior was of border -\\nline significance at immediate posttest, these behaviors showed a con -\\ntinued decline at the 1-year follow-up, Results indicated that a video-based training program with a discussion group was an effective tool inteaching parenting skills. While both training methods were effective,\\nthe cost effectiveness of video-based training compared with the expen -\\nsive individualized one-to-one training allow for cost-effective, large-\\nscale dissemination.\\nMore recently, Bradley et al. (2003) used a randomized control group\\ndesign to investigate the ability of the 1-2-3 Magic (Phelan, 1990) video\\nto teach parenting skills in a community agency to parents of preschool -\\ners who were experiencing difficulties managing their children\\u2019s be -\\nhavior. Parent-child dyads were randomly assigned to an experimentalgroup, which viewed the 1-2-3 Magic video or to a wait-list control\\ngroup. Child behavior (e.g., aggression, anxiety, hyperactivity), par-enting behavior (e.g., anger, irritability, failure to enforce rules), current\\nlevel of parental stress, and child temperament (e.g., difficultness) were\\nassessed via parent report three months later. Consistent with Webster-Stratton\\u2019s findings, Bradley et al.\\u2019s (2003) study supported video-based\\ninstruction as an effective tool to teach parents effective parenting strat-\\negies. Parents in the intervention group reported decreases in their child\\u2019soverall problematic behavior, hyperactivity and distractibility. Further-more, parents who received intervention reported significant changes to\\ntheir child\\u2019s temperament including decreased rates of persistence, neg-\\native adaptation and affect, and degree of difficulty. Moreover, parentswho received video-based instruction perceived their children as more\\ncompliant and happier.\\nPurpose of This Study\\nThere were two main purposes of this study. First, we were interested\\nin examining the effect of the RTTT video on caregivers\\u2019 use of dialogic\\nreading behaviors when reading with their children. It was hypothesized\\nthat caregivers, who viewed the video, would increase their use of DR\\nstrategies when reading with their children compared with (1) their use of\\nDR strategies before viewing the video; and (2) caregivers who did notview the video. In addition, it was hypothesized that the increased level of\\nDR strategy use would be maintained at a 12-week follow-up. The sec -\\nond purpose of this study was to examine the effect of the parent trainingon children\\u2019s verbalizations during shared book reading. Specifically, we120 JOURNAL OF APPLIED SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGY\\nhypothesized that children whose parent viewed the video would engage\\nin higher levels of verbalizations during shared book reading comparedwith (1) their verbalizations during shared book reading before their par -\\nent viewed the video; and (2) the verbalizations of children whose parents\\ndid not view the video. In addition, we hypothesized that the improve -\\nments would be maintained at a 12-week follow-up.\\nFrom the literature conducted in the area of DR, it is clear that using\\nDR strategies when reading with young children is associated with im -\\nproved oral language skills. The present study is unique in that it is thefirst to examine the effects of the commercially available RTTT video\\non parents\\u2019 reading behaviors. In addition, this study is important be -\\ncause it examined the use of video-based parent training to promotechild development in the waiting room of community health centers(CHCs), a venue not previously investigated, yet important given the\\ntime that parents spend in this environment with their young children.\\nMETHOD\\nParticipants\\nEighteen parent-child dyads, who received their primary health care\\nat CHCs, participated in this study. Due to the relatively small sample\\nsize of this study, which would not be able to take into account the ef-\\nfects of account language differences, families were required to speak\\nEnglish as their primary language to be included in this preliminary in-vestigation. Families were recruited for the study through targeted mail -\\nings, phone calls, and through fliers posted on the walls of the CHCs.\\nParent-child dyads were randomly assigned to an experimental ( N=8 )\\nand control (N = 10) group. Demographic information describing the\\nfamilies is presented in Table 1.\\nSetting and Intervention\\nThis study was conducted at two CHCs in an urban setting in the\\nNortheast. Both CHCs provide primary care to large numbers of ethni -\\ncally and racially diverse families with and without health insurance.\\nCaregivers in the experimental group viewed the 15-minute RTTT\\ndialogic training video (Pearson Early Learning, 2002) on a TV/VCR in\\nthe waiting room of the CHC. The video included a description of the\\ndialogic reading strategies as well as modeling of the various strategies.Blom-Hoffman et al. 121\\nPlease refer to Blom-Hoffman et al. (in press) for a more comprehen-\\nsive description of the RTTT video.\\nProcedures and Materials\\nCaregiver-child participation in this study involved three visits to the\\nCHC during regular clinic hours. Regardless of group assignment, sub-jects\\u2019 baseline assessmen ts during the first visit were the same. All care-giver-child dyads participated in a five-minute, videotaped observation.Caregivers were instructed \\u201cto read together with your child as you do athome.\\u201d Following the observation, the caregivers were asked to reporthow similar the videotaped observation was to reading together at home.\\nFollowing baseline assessment, caregivers in the experimental group\\nviewed the RTTT video. In addition, they were provided with a lami -\\nnated handout and bookmark, developed by the first author that high -\\nlighted and summarized key points in the video. Caregivers in the\\ncontrol group did not view the video. Instead, they received a generic\\nbookmark entitled, \\u201c 7 Super Things Parents and Caregivers Can Do \\u201d\\n(Early Childhood-Head Start Taskforce & U.S. Department of Educa -\\ntion & U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, n.d.). All chil -\\ndren, regardless of group assignment, received three books at the end of\\nthe first visit.\\nImmediately after viewing the videotape, caregivers in the experimental\\ngroup completed a modified version of the Intervention Rating Profile122 JOURNAL OF APPLIED SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGY\\nTABLE 1.  Caregiver and Child Descriptive Information\\nExperimental Group ( N= 8) Control Group ( N= 10)\\nChild (age in months) M= 44.5; SD= 9.2 M= 37.2; SD= 8.0\\nRace/Ethnicity (%)\\nAsian or Pacific Islander 12.5 0\\nBlack, not Latino/Latina 37.5 30\\nWhite, not Latino/Latina 50 70\\nCaregiver Education Level (%)\\nSome high school (didn\\u2019t finish) 12.5 0\\nHigh school degree 12.5 20\\nSome college or trade school 37.5 60\\n4-year college degree 12.5 10\\nCollege /H11001 25 10\\n(IRP; Martens & Witt, 1982). The seven-item, modified IRP was adminis -\\ntered to assess caregiver acceptability of the videotape and DR strategies.\\nCaregiver acceptability of the videotaped training program, determined\\nto be high, is described elsewhere (Blom-Hoffman et al., in press).\\nThe second and third visits occurred approximately 6 and 12 weeks,\\nrespectively, following the first visit. Five-minute videotaped observa -\\ntions of parent-child reading interactions were conducted using the\\nsame procedures as before. At the end of both of these visits, caregiversreceived a monetary stipend, and children received another book.\\nData Coding\\nTwo school psychology graduate students transcribed the videotaped\\nobservations. Subsequently, they were trained to observe parent behav -\\niors using a code that included seven DR prompts plus an additional\\nprompt called \\u201cattending\\u201d statements (see Appendix). Once the observ-ers reached a predetermined 90% level of agreement for each behavior,\\nthey independently coded the parent statements from the transcriptions.\\nAfter coding the caregiver statements, they summed each category toyield a frequency count for each of the eight prompt categories. Finally,\\nthe observers summed the frequencies from all the eight DR categories\\ninto a general category called \\u201cfacilitating verbalizations.\\u201d\\nTo assess child verbalizing behaviors during each reading obser-\\nvation, a third research assistant, who is a school psychologist, used a\\n10-second partial interval recording procedure to code on- and off-task\\nverbalizations. On-task verbalizations were defined as child commentsabout something related to the book, including answers to questionsposed by the caregiver and questions asked about the book. Off-task\\nverbalizations included comments and questions that were not related to\\nthe book (e.g., \\u201cI want juice\\u201d) and responses to caregiver questions thatwere not related to the book (e.g, \\u201cno,\\u201d when asked if he/she had to go to\\nthe bathroom). Once the research assistant reached a predetermined\\nlevel of inter-observer agreement with the first author (i.e., 90% agree -\\nment) the research assistant independently coded the videotapes.\\nRESULTS\\nIn general, parents reported that the reading observations in the clinic\\nwere quite (i.e., 56%) or somewhat (i.e., 33%) similar to when they read\\nwith their child at home. Following a minority of the observations (11%),Blom-Hoffman et al. 123\\nparents reported that the reading observations were not similar to when\\nthey read with their child at home. Reasons for lack of similarity included\\nreading location (i.e., sitting in a chair in the health center as opposed to\\nlying on their child\\u2019s bed) and distraction from the video camera.\\nParent Verbalizations During Shared Book Reading\\nTo assess inter-rater agreement, two trained research assistants inde -\\npendently coded 26% of all transcripts of videotaped reading observa -\\ntions. For each parent statement, each research assistant coded 1 of 8\\nparent facilitating verbalizations. Total inter-rater agreement [agree -\\nments/(agreements /H11001disagreements) * 100] was calculated for each\\ncategory. Inter-rater agreement was good for all categories ( = 97.8%;\\nrange between 91.6% and 100%).\\nOf the 18 cases studied, 4 (i.e., 2 experimental and 2 control dyads)\\nhad one missing videotape observation data point due to a missed ap-pointment. In other words, 7% of the videotaped observations were\\nmissing from the data set. These data were replaced with group means.\\nFigure 1 displays combined parent facilitating behaviors for the treat-\\nment and control group over the three measurement occasions (pre-124 JOURNAL OF APPLIED SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGY\\nFIGURE 1.

First,\\nwe assessed differences between groups at each time point using Co -\\nhen\\u2019s dfrom t-tests (Thalheimer & Cook, 2002). Magnitudes of effects\\nwere assessed using Cohen\\u2019s (1992) criteria wherein the magnitude ofeffect sizes (ES ) can be categorized as small (between .15 and .40),\\nmoderate (between .40 and .75), or large (>.75). Results indicate no dif -\\nference between the experimental (\\n= 17.63;S D= 8.75) and control\\n(= 17.93;S D= 10.68) groups at pre-treatment ( ES= .03). However, a\\nlarge effect (ES = 2.26) as a function of intervention was noted at the\\n6-week follow-up, where parent facilitating verbalizations in the exper -\\nimental group demonstrated nearly a twofold increase from pre-treat -\\nment ( = 32.27;S D= 9.4) compared with a small decrease in the\\ncontrol group ( = 16.15;S D = 6.78). This large effect remained rela -\\ntively stable at the 12-week follow-up ( ES= 1.36). Here parents in the\\nexperimental group maintained relatively high levels of facilitating ver-balizations (\\n= 30.51;S D= 14) compared with low and stable verbal-\\nizations for control group parents ( = 14.52 ; SD = 11.22).\\nThe effect of the videotape intervention on parents\\u2019 use of specific DR\\nstrategies was also assessed. Results indicated that certain types ofprompts were used more frequently by parents who viewed the video,while others were utilized infrequently by parents in both groups. Specifi-\\ncally, at the second visit, parents who viewed the RTTT video used more\\npage prompts (e.g., wh-type questions;\\n= 18.46; SD= 8.95) than care-\\ngivers who did not received the video-based training ( = 6.75; SD=\\n5.32). Furthermore, parents who viewed the video showed a greater useof evaluation prompts (\\n= 6.66; SD= 3.4) compared with those who did\\nnot receive the video training ( = 2.62; SD= 2.11). Other DR strategies,\\nhowever, such as expansion, repetition, recall and distancing promptswere used infrequently by caregivers in both groups across sessions. It is\\nimportant to note that wh-/open-ended questions (i.e., page prompts) andevaluation prompts are interdependent; in other words, if a parent asks\\nmore wh-type questions and the child responds, there are more opportu -\\nnities for the parent to evaluate the child\\u2019s response.\\nChild Verbalizations During Shared Book Reading\\nA trained research assistant and the first author independently coded\\n20% of the videotaped reading observations. Total inter-rater agree -\\nment [agreements/(agreements /H11001disagreements) * 100] was calculated\\nfor each category. Inter-rater agreement was good for observations ofBlom-Hoffman et al. 125\\non-task ( = 95%; Range = 87-100%) and off-task behavior ( = 99%;\\nRange = 93-100%).\\nFigure 2 displays experimental and control group children\\u2019s on-task\\nverbalizations at three points in time (i.e., pre-treatment, 6 weeks post-\\ntreatment, and 12 weeks post-treatment). Differences between groups at\\neach time point were assessed using Cohen\\u2019s dfrom t-tests (Thalheimer &\\nCook, 2002). At pre-treatment, there was no difference between the ex -\\nperimental ( = 28.24;S D= 22.86) and control ( /H9273= 32.7 ;S D= 22.61)\\ngroups with regard to child on-task verbalizations ( ES=/H11002.021). How -\\never, at the 6-week follow-up, a large effect ( ES= .78) as a function of\\nintervention was noted. Experimental group children\\u2019s on-task verbal -\\nizations increased ( =39.42;S D= 20.67) and control group children\\u2019s\\non-task verbalizations remained at a level similar to that observed during\\nthe first visit (/H9273 = 25.4;S D = 17.96). At the 12-week follow-up, a very\\nlarge effect as a result of the intervention was noted ( ES= 1.26). Here\\nchildren in the experimental group showed nearly a twofold increase\\nrelative to pre-treatment in their levels of on-task verbalizations ( =\\n50.36;S D= 18.39) compared with much lower levels of on-task verbal-\\nizations from children in the control group ( = 28.11;S D= 19.02).\\nLevels of off-task verbalizations during shared book reading were low\\nin both groups and during each of the three visits (e.g., 3-15%).126 JOURNAL OF APPLIED SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGY\\nFIGURE 2. Percentage of Child On-Task Verbalizations During Shared Book\\nReading.\\nDISCUSSION\\nSummary of Findings\\nDialogic reading (DR) strategies have been found to facilitate the de -\\nvelopment of oral language and emergent literacy skills in toddlers and\\npreschool age children at home, school, and daycare settings (e.g.,\\nArnold, Lonigan, Whitehurst, & Epstein, 1994; Lonigan & Whitehurst,1998; Whitehurst, Arnold, Epstein, Angell, Smith, & Fischel, 1994;\\nWhitehurst, Epstein, Angell, Payne, Crone, & Fischel, 1994; White -\\nhurst, Zevenbergen, Crone, Schultz, Velting, & Fischel, 1999; White -\\nhurst et al., 1988). In these settings, caregiver training to use DR\\nstrategies with young children has been successfully provided \\u201clive\\u201d\\nand via videotape (Arnold et al., 1994; Whitehurst et al., 1988, 1994a,b,\\n1999). In the current study, caregivers in CHCs learned to use DR strat-egies through videotape training, and they maintained their use of DRstrategies when reading with their preschool children 12 weeks later.\\nAlso, children\\u2019s levels of on-task verbalizations increased when their\\nparents engaged them using DR strategies during shared book reading.These results reinforce the use of videotape-based DR training to\\ncaregivers, and they promote such caregiver training in CHCs.\\nParents spend a great deal of time in CHCs with their young children.\\nFor example, parents bring their preschool-aged children to CHCs for\\nwellness visits and for visits related to illness (e.g., of the parent, the\\npreschool child, and/or a younger or older sibling). Often families arrive\\nfor appointments at CHCs early; sometimes health care professionalsare unavoidably running late. In both cases, families pass time in health\\ncare center waiting areas, creating a valuable opportunity for them to\\nlearn strategies they can use to facilitate their children\\u2019s languagedevelopment when reading to their children.\\nIn addition to being an ideal environment for training parents to use\\nstrategies to facilitate aspects of their children\\u2019s language development,CHCs are also a highly acceptable environment for the provision of thistraining. As described elsewhere, provision of a videotape-based DRtraining program to parents in the waiting areas of the two CHCs where\\nthis study was conducted was judged as being highly acceptable to the\\ncaregivers who participated in this study and to the staff at the twocenters (Blom-Hoffman et al., in press).\\nUse of video-based training in general has definite advantages. These\\ninclude standardization of the targeted intervention (i.e., information isprovided consistently) and cost effectiveness from personnel and timeBlom-Hoffman et al. 127\\nperspectives (i.e., staff do not have to be physically present to provide\\ntraining). An advantage of the DR videotape in particular is that it pro -\\nvides multiple examples of parents reading to their children using theDR strategies being taught (Arnold et al., 1994). From a learning theoryperspective, such observational methods are highly e ffective in teaching\\ntarget behaviors (Bandura, 1986).\\nLimitations\\nThe findings of this study are best viewed as preliminary due to the\\nlimited sample size in terms of parent-child dyads and CHCs. Future\\nstudies with larger samples of diverse parents, children and CHCs willelucidate the degree to which these findings generalize to other popula -\\ntions and settings.\\nAn additional limitation involves the potential for parent and child\\nreactivity to being videotaped. Parents and children knew that they werebeing observed while reading together; therefore, the improvements in\\nparents\\u2019 use of the reading strategies may have been limited to the vid-\\neotaped clinic session. We attempted to measure this by asking the par-ents to report how similar the observation was to their typical reading at\\nhome. Most of the time (i.e., 89%) parents reported that the observa-\\ntions were quite or somewhat similar to their typical reading interac-tions at home. However, it is unclear to what degree the behaviorchanges observed in the experimental group generalized to interactions\\nat home.\\nDirections for Future Research\\nDetermining that caregivers in CHCs can learn and maintain their use\\nof DR strategies from a commercially available training video is an\\nimportant step. Despite the fact that the parents\\u2019 overall use of DR strat -\\negies increased, the increase was related to their use of two of the strate -\\ngies in particular (i.e., page prompts and evaluation prompts). The nextstep is to determine how to encourage parents to learn to use some of theDR strategies which our data indicate they did not use before or after\\nviewing the video. Some of these strategies, such as expansion, recall,\\nand repetition, may have been less familiar to the parents, and they mayneed additional instruction and feedback beyond that provided in the\\nvideo to use them. In addition, it will be important to examine the viabil -\\nity of this intervention with other groups, such as families who do notspeak English as their primary language, and with children with lan -128 JOURNAL OF APPLIED SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGY\\nguage delays. The ability of this video when shown in other settings\\nwhere parents spend time (e.g., at home, in homeless shelters, during\\nparent nights at preschool) to alter parent reading behaviors should be\\nexamined as well.\\nThis study contributes to the DR literature by providing initial sup -\\nport for the use of the RTTT video in helping parents learn DR strate -\\ngies. It is impressive that a short video shown only at one time andwithout discussion or feedback has the ability to change parent readingbehaviors and rates of task-specific child verbalizations during shared\\nbook reading and that these changes are maintained over time. In addi -\\ntion, this study demonstrated the delivery of this type instruction to par -\\nents in a novel setting where parents bring their children.\\nDirections for Practice\\nIt is important for school psychologists to be familiar with DR, as an\\nevidence-based literacy promotion practice. Given their roles as consul-\\ntants and trainers it is important to be aware of materials available to dis-\\nseminate these strategies to preschool teachers and to parents of youngchildren. The results of this pilot study investigating the effects of RTTT\\non parent and child behaviors during shared book reading indicate thatthis video is associated with increases in some parent facilitating strate-gies and child task related verbalizations. Using information from thisstudy and other sources of information about DR (e.g., Zevenbergen &\\nWhitehurst, 2003) school psychologists and their educator colleagues\\ncan facilitate a training program for family members with young chil-dren regarding the importance of shared book reading and the use of\\nDR strategies. This type of training program can be conducted in pre -\\nschools, libraries, churches, and other community centers where parentsspend time. The RTTT video can be shown to parents, followed by op -\\nportunities for parents to practice the strategies and to receive feedback\\nfrom facilitators. In addition, families can be given a bookmark or hand -\\nout of helpful hints to take home as a reminder of important DR strate -\\ngies. To reach parents whose schedules do not permit them to attend thistype of training program, school psychologists and teachers can preparereader-friendly information that can be sent home to families about DR\\nand can make available the RTTT videotape for families to borrow to\\nview at home. DR is an evidence-based approach to engage young chil -\\ndren in shared book reading. School psychologists and our educator\\ncolleagues can play an important role in disseminating informationabout DR to caregivers.Blom-Hoffman et al. 129\\nREFERENCES\\nArnold, D. H., Lonigan, C.
