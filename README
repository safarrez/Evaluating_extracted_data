# Table Extraction Service

## Overview
This project provides two complementary services for extracting structured table fields from scientific PDF papers:

1. **Prompt-based Extraction**: Uses a generative LLM (`llama-3.1-8b-instant` via Groq) with prompt engineering to extract key fields.
2. **Fine-tuned Extraction**: Uses a LoRA-fine-tuned Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct model to perform end-to-end extraction.

## Models
- **Prompt Model**: `llama-3.1-8b-instant` (Groq provider)
- **Fine-tuned Model**: `meta-llama/Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct` with LoRA adapter (saved in `./llama3-extraction-lora`)

## Data Sources
The extraction models were trained and evaluated on a dataset of 32 PDF–table pairs, including studies such as:
- Coyne et al. (2004)
- Vaknin‑Nusbaum & Nevo (2017)
- Yeh & Connell (2008)

PDF files reside under `data/pdfs/` and corresponding ground-truth tables under `data/tables/`. The master Excel mapping is `data/data.xlsx`.

## Setup
1. **Python & Environment**
   - Python 3.11
   - CUDA-capable GPU
2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
